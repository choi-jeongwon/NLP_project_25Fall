2,"On the Nature of Infrared Singularities in $d\leq 2$ Disordered
  Interacting Systems","We address the problem of infrared singularities in the perturbation theory for disordered interacting systems in $d\leq 2$. We show that a typical, sufficiently large interacting system exhibits a linear instability in the spin triplet channel. In a density-density channel, although stability is preserved, a large number of soft modes is accumulated. These phenomena are responsible for the instability of the weak-interacting fixed point. Although generic, the unstable direction and soft modes are highly sample specific and can not be effectively captured by conventional techniques based on an averaging procedure. Rather, the instability is determined by the largest eigenvalues of the polarization operator. We propose to employ the optimal fluctuation method for evaluating the probability of such events.",cond
3,Theory of tunneling spectroscopy in superconducting Sr2RuO4,A theory for tunneling spectroscopy in normal metal /insulator/triplet superconductor junction is presented. We assume two kinds of non-unitary triplet superconducting states which are the most promising states for Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$. The calculated conductance spectra showzero-bias peaks as well as gap structures. The existences of residual components in the spectra reflect the non-unitary properties of superconducting states.,cond
4,Dynamical Exchange Effects in a Two-Dimensional Many-Polaron Gas,"We calculate the influence of dynamical exchange effects on the response properties and the static properties of a two-dimensional many-polaron gas. These effects are not manifested in the random-phase approximation which is widely used in the analysis of the many-polaron system. Here they are taken into account by using a dielectric function derived in the time-dependent Hartree-Fock formalism. At weak electron-phonon coupling, we find that dynamical exchange effects lead to substantial corrections to the random-phase approximation results for the ground state energy, the effective mass, and the optical conductivity of the polaron system. Furthermore, we show that the reduction of the spectral weight of the optical absorption spectrum at frequencies above the longitudinal optical phonon frequency, due to many-body effects, is overestimated by the random-phase approximation.",cond
5,Low temperature resistivity in a nearly half-metallic ferromagnet,"We consider electron transport in a nearly half-metallic ferromagnet, in which the minority spin electrons close to the band edge at the Fermi energy are Anderson-localized due to disorder. For the case of spin-flip scattering of the conduction electrons due to the absorption and emission of magnons, the Boltzmann equation is exactly soluble to the linear order. From this solution we calculate the temperature dependence of the resistivity due to single magnon processes at sufficiently low temperature, namely $k_BT\ll D/L^2$, where $L$ is the Anderson localization length and $D$ is the magnon stiffness. And depending on the details of the minority spin density of states at the Fermi level, we find a $T^{1.5}$ or $T^{2}$ scaling behavior for resistivity. Relevance to the doped perovskite manganite systems is discussed.",cond
6,Quantum Glass Transition in a Periodic Long-Range Josephson Array,"We show that the ground state of the periodic long range Josephson array frustrated by magnetic field is a glass for a sufficiently large Josephson energies despite the absence of a quenched disorder. Like superconductors, this glass state has non-zero phase stiffness and Meissner response; for smaller Josephson energies the glass ""melts"" and the ground state loses the phase stiffness and becomes insulating. We find the critical scaling behavior near this quantum phase transition: the excitation gap vanishes as (J-J_c)^2, the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility behaves as \chi(\omega) ~ \sqrt{\omega}\ln{\omega}.",cond
7,Fingering Instability of Dislocations and Related Defects,"We identify a fundamental morphological instability of mobile dislocations in crystals and related line defects. A positive gradient in the local driving force along the direction of defect motion destabilizes long-wavelength vibrational modes, producing a ``fingering'' pattern. The minimum unstable wavelength scales as the inverse square root of the force gradient. We demonstrate the instability's onset in simulations of a screw dislocation in Al (via molecular dynamics) and of a vortex in a 3-d XY ``rotator'' model.",cond
8,"Systematic vertex corrections through iterative solution of Hedin's
  equations beyond the GW approximation","We present a general procedure for obtaining progressively more accurate functional expressions for the electron self-energy by iterative solution of Hedin's coupled equations. The iterative process starting from Hartree theory, which gives rise to the GW approximation, is continued further, and an explicit formula for the vertex function from the second full cycle is given. Calculated excitation energies for a Hubbard Hamiltonian demonstrate the convergence of the iterative process and provide further strong justification for the GW approximation.",cond
9,Winding Angle Distributions for Directed Polymers,"We study analytically and numerically the winding of directed polymers of length $t$ around each other or around a rod. Unconfined polymers in pure media have exponentially decaying winding angle distributions, the decay constant depending on whether the interaction is repulsive or neutral, but not on microscopic details. In the presence of a chiral asymmetry, the exponential tails become non universal. In all these cases the mean winding angle is proportional to $\ln t$. When the polymer is confined to a finite region around the winding center, e.g. due to an attractive interaction, the winding angle distribution is Gaussian, with a variance proportional to $t$. We also examine the windings of polymers in random systems. Our results suggest that randomness reduces entanglements, leading to a narrow (Gaussian) distribution with a mean winding angle of the order of $\sqrt{\ln t}$.",cond
10,Soliton Analysis of the Electro-Optical Response of Blue Bronze,"In recent measurements on the charge-density-wave (CDW) conductor blue bronze (K0.3MoO3), the electro-transmittance and electro-reflectance spectra were searched for intragap states that could be associated with solitons created by injection of electrons into the CDW at the current contacts [Eur. Phys. J. B 16, 295 (2000); ibid 35, 233 (2003)]. In this work, we adapt the model of soliton absorption in dimerized polyacetylene to the blue bronze results, to obtain the (order of magnitude) estimate that current induced solitons occur on less than ~ 10% of the conducting chains. We discuss the implications of these results on models of soliton lifetimes and motion of CDW phase dislocations.",cond
11,"Friedel oscillations induced by non-magnetic impurities in the
  two-dimensional Hubbard model","We study the interplay of correlations and disorder using an unrestricted Slave-Boson technique in real space. Within the saddle-point approximation, we find Friedel oscillations of the charge density in the vicinity of a nonmagnetic impurity, in agreement with numerical simulations. The corresponding amplitudes are suppressed by repulsive interactions, while attractive correlations lead to a charge-density-wave enhancement. In addition, we investigate the spatial dependence of the local magnetic moment and the formation of a magnetic state at the impurity site.",cond
12,"Logarithmic divergence of normal state resistivity of bipolaronic
  high-$T_{c}$ cuprates",The resonance Wigner scattering of charged bosons (small bipolarons) in a random potential leads to logarithmically divergent low-temperature resistivity as observed in several cuprates. Unusual temperature dependence of resistivity of $La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$ as well as of the Hall effect is quantitatively described in a wide temperature range providing an evidence for $2e$ charged Bose-liquid in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates.,cond
13,"An ansatz for the nonlinear Demkov-Kunike problem for cold molecule
  formation","We study nonlinear mean-field dynamics of ultracold molecule formation in the case when the external field configuration is defined by the level-crossing Demkov-Kunike model, characterized by a bell-shaped coupling and finite variation of the detuning. Analyzing the fast sweep rate regime of the strong interaction limit, which models a situation when the peak value of the coupling is large enough and the resonance crossing is sufficiently fast, we construct a highly accurate ansatz to describe the temporal dynamics of the molecule formation in the mentioned interaction regime. The absolute error of the constructed approximation is less than 3*10^-6 for the final transition probability while at certain time points it might increase up to 10^-3. Examining the role of the different terms in the constructed approximation, we prove that in the fast sweep rate regime of the strong interaction limit the temporal dynamics of the atom-molecule conversion effectively consists of the process of resonance crossing, which is governed by a nonlinear equation, followed by atom-molecular coherent oscillations which are basically described by a solution of the linear problem, associated with the considered nonlinear one.",cond
14,N electrons in a quantum dot: Two-point Pade approximants,We present analytic estimates for the energy levels of N electrons (N = 2 - 5) in a two-dimensional parabolic quantum dot. A magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the confinement plane. The relevant scaled energy is shown to be a smooth function of the parameter \beta=(effective Rydberg/effective dot energy)^{1/6}. Two-point Pade approximants are obtained from the series expansions of the energy near the oscillator ($\beta\to 0$) and Wigner ($\beta\to\infty$) limits. The approximants are expected to work with an error not greater than 2.5% in the entire interval $0\le\beta < \infty$.,cond
15,Hall Effect in the mixed state of moderately clean superconductors,The Hall conductivity in the mixed state of a clean ($l \gg \xi_0$) type-II s-wave superconductor is determined from a microscopic calculation within a quasiclassical approximation. We find that below the superconducting transition the contribution to the transverse conductivity due to dynamical fluctuations of the order parameter is compensated by the modification of the quasiparticle contribution. In this regime the nonlinear behaviour of the Hall angle is governed by the change in the effective quasiparticle scattering rate due to the reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level. The connection with experimental results is discussed.,cond
16,"Domain wall roughening in disordered media: From local spin dynamics to
  a continuum description of the interface",We study the kinetic roughening of a driven domain wall between spin-up and spin-down domains for a model with non-conserved order parameter and quenched disorder. To understand the scaling behavior of this interface we construct an equation of motion and study it theoretically.,cond
17,How Famous is a Scientist? -- Famous to Those Who Know Us,"Following a recent idea, to measure fame by the number of \Google hits found in a search on the WWW, we study the relation between fame (\Google hits) and merit (number of papers posted on an electronic archive) for a random group of scientists in condensed matter and statistical physics. Our findings show that fame and merit in science are linearly related, and that the probability distribution for a certain level of fame falls off exponentially. This is in sharp contrast with the original findings about WW II ace pilots, for which fame is exponentially related to merit (number of downed planes), and the probability of fame decays in power-law fashion. Other groups in our study show similar patterns of fame as for ace pilots.",cond
18,"Measurement of Resonant Frequency and Quality Factor of Microwave
  Resonators: Comparison of Methods","Precise microwave measurements of sample conductivity, dielectric, and magnetic properties are routinely performed with cavity perturbation measurements. These methods require the accurate determination of quality factor and resonant frequency of microwave resonators. Seven different methods to determine the resonant frequency and quality factor from complex transmission coefficient data are discussed and compared to find which is most accurate and precise when tested using identical data. We find that the nonlinear least-squares fit to the phase vs. frequency is the most accurate and precise when the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than 65. For noisier data, the nonlinear least squares fit to a Lorentzian curve is more accurate and precise. The results are general and can be applied to the analysis of many kinds of resonant phenomena.",cond
19,A simple variational approach for an interacting Fermi trapped gas,"Quantum states of a two-component Fermi trapped gas are described by introducing an effective trap frequency, determined via variational techniques. Closed expressions for the contribution of a contact interaction potential to the total energy and the pairing interaction are derived. They are valid for both few and large number of particles, given the discrete nature of the formulation, and therefore richer than the continuous expressions, which are perfectly matched. Pairing energies within a shell are explicitly evaluated and its allowed values at a given energy level delimited. We show the importance of the interaction over the trap energy as the number of particles ($N$) grows and the temperature decreases. At zero temperature we find a polynomial dependence of the interaction energy on the Fermi energy, whose dominant term at large $N$ corresponds with the mean field approximation result. In addition, the role of the strength of an attractive potential on the total energy is exhibited.",cond
20,"Lattice Dynamics of Martensitic Transformations Examined by Atomistic
  Simulations","We have performaed molecular dynamics simulations of Fe(80)Ni(20) alloys using an inter-atomic potential of the EAM-type which allows the simulation of the martensite-austenite transition. We present results, showing the development of an inhomogeneous shear system on a nanoscale during the thermally induced austenitic transition. In addition to this we obtained the phonon dispersion relations of the martensite phase by calculating the dynamical structure factor from our simulation results. On approaching the transition temperature the phonon dispersion shows anomalies which might be connected with the formation of the microstructure during the austenitic transition.",cond
21,"Slave-Boson Mean-Field Theory of the Antiferromagnetic State in the
  Doubly Degenerate Hubbard Model - the Half-Filled Case -","The antiferromagnetic ground state of the half-filled Hubbard model with the doubly degenerate orbital has been studied by using the slave-boson mean-field theory which was previously proposed by the present author. Numerical calculations for the simple cubic model have shown that the metal-insulator transition does not take place except at the vanishing interaction point, in strong contrast with its paramagnetic solution. The energy gap in the density of states of the antiferromagnetic insulator is much reduced by the effect of electron correlation. The exchange interaction $J$ plays an important role in the antiferromagnetism: although for $J = 0$ the sublattice magnetic moment $m$ in our theory is fairly smaller than $m_{HFA}$ obtained in the Hartree-Fock approximation, $m$ for $J/U > 0.2$ ($U$: the Coulomb interaction) is increased to become comparable to $m_{HFA}$. Surprisingly, the antiferromagnetic state is easily destroyed if a small, negative exchange interaction ($J/U < -0.05$) is introduced.",cond
22,"Investigation of the annealed disordered Ising systems within two-tail
  approximation","In the present paper an approach for investigation of the disordered two-component Ising systems with long range interaction has been suggested. Possible applications to metalic and magnetic alloys and lattice gas are considered. We have also obtained numerical results for thermodynamical properties of these models. The comparison of numerical results obtained within mean field, gaussian field and two-tail approximations are carried out.",cond
23,"Photoemission spectra of the t-J model in 1 and 2D: similarities and
  differences","We present an exact diagonalization study of the single particle spectral function in the 1D and 2D t-J model. By studying the scaling properties with J and t we find a simple building pattern in 1D and show that every spectral feature can be uniquely assigned by a spinon and holon momentum. We find two types of low energy excitations: a band with energy scale J and high spectral weight disperses upwards in the interior part of the Brillouin zone and reaches E_F at k_F, and a band with energy scale t and low spectral weight disperses downwards in the outer part of the zone, touching E_F at 3k_F. An analogous analysis of the 2D case at half filling shows that the t-band exists also in this case, but is diffuse and never reaches the Fermi energy. For the doped case in 2D the picture is more reminiscent of 1D, in particular the `main-band' with a dispersion proportional J and the `shadow band' with energy scale t can be identified also in this case. This leads us to propose that the shadow bands discovered by Aebi et al. in Bi2212 are the 2D analogue of the 3k_F singularity in 1D systems and unrelated to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.",cond
24,The Fermi surface of underdoped high-T_c superconducting cuprates,"The coexistence of $\pi$-flux state and d-wave RVB state is considered in this paper within the slave boson approach. A critical value of doping concentration $\delta_c$ is found, below which the coexisting $\pi$-flux and d-wave RVB state is favored in energy. The pseudo Fermi surface of spinons and the physical electron spectral function are calculated. A clear Fermi-level crossing is found along the (0,0) to ($\pi$, $\pi$) direction, but no such crossing is detected along the ($\pi$, 0) to ($\pi$, $\pi$) direction. Also, an energy gap of d-wave symmetry appears at the Fermi level in our calculation. The above results are in agreement with the angle-resolved photoemission experiments which indicate at a d-wave pseudo-gap and a half-pocket-like Fermi surface in underdoped cuprates.",cond
25,Neural networks and logical reasoning systems. A translation table,"A correspondence is established between the elements of logic reasoning systems (knowledge bases, rules, inference and queries) and the hardware and dynamical operations of neural networks. The correspondence is framed as a general translation dictionary which, hopefully, will allow to go back and forth between symbolic and network formulations, a desirable step in learning-oriented systems and multicomputer networks. In the framework of Horn clause logics it is found that atomic propositions with n arguments correspond to nodes with n-th order synapses, rules to synaptic intensity constraints, forward chaining to synaptic dynamics and queries either to simple node activation or to a query tensor dynamics.",cond
26,"Low temperature hcp to monoclinic structural transition in solid
  C$_{70}$ : Is there an intermediate phase?""","We follow the structural transformation in solid C$_{70}$ from the high temperature hcp to a low temperature monoclinic phase using x-ray diffraction studies at controlled cooling-rates from 0.0033 to 0.42 K/min. Rapid cooling of the sample gives the signature of a two-step transformation which disappears when the system is transformaed quasi-statically. These experimental results can be rationalised using a simple mean field, Langevin dynamical theory using a free energy functional with minima corresponding to the parent and two competing product phases such that one of these product phases remains metastable throughout. The implication of our results on the existence of the intermediate phase in the sequence, hcp-dhcp-monoclinic, of structural transitions in solid C$_{70}$ with the lowering of temperature is discussed.",cond
27,"Ewald methods for polarizable surfaces with application to hydroxylation
  and hydrogen bonding on the (012) and (001) surfaces of alpha-Fe2O3","We present a clear and rigorous derivation of the Ewald-like method for calculation of the electrostatic energy of the systems infinitely periodic in two-dimensions and of finite size in the third dimension (slabs) which is significantly faster than existing methods. Molecular dynamics simulations using the transferable/polarizable model by Rustad et al. were applied to study the surface relaxation of the nonhydroxylated, hydroxylated, and solvated surfaces of alpha-Fe2O3 (hematite). We find that our nonhydroxylated structures and energies are in good agreement with previous LDA calculations on alpha-alumina by Manassidis et al. [Surf. Sci. Lett. 285, L517, 1993]. Using the results of molecular dynamics simulations of solvated interfaces, we define end-member hydroxylated-hydrated states for the surfaces which are used in energy minimization calculations. We find that hydration has a small effect on the surface structure, but that hydroxylation has a significant effect. Our calculations, both for gas-phase and solution-phase adsorption, predict a greater amount of hydroxylation for the (012) surface than for the (001) surface. Our simulations also indicate the presence of four-fold coordinated iron ions on the (001) surface.",cond
28,Correlated-electron theory of strongly anisotropic metamagnets,"The microscopic origin of metamagnetism and metamagnetic transitions in strongly anisotropic antiferromagnets is investigated within a quantum mechanical theory of correlated electrons. To this end the Hubbard model with staggered magnetization m_st along an easy axis e in a magnetic field H || e is studied both analytically and numerically within the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). At intermediate couplings the self-consistent DMFT equations, which become exact in the limit of large coordination number, are solved by finite temperature Quantum Monte Carlo techniques. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the homogeneous and staggered magnetization are calculated and the magnetic phase diagram is constructed. At half filling the metamagnetic transitions are found to change from first order at low temperatures to second order near the N'eel temperature, implying the existence of a multicritical point. Doping with holes or electrons has a strong effect: the system becomes metallic, the electronic compressibility increases and the critical temperatures and fields decrease. These results are related to known properties of insulating metamagnets such as FeBr_2, metallic metamagnets such as UPdGe, and the giant and colossal magnetoresistance found in a number of magnetic bulk systems.",cond
29,"Anomalous suppression of the Bose glass at commensurate fillings in the
  disordered Bose-Hubbard model","We study the weakly disordered Bose-Hubbard model on a cubic lattice through a one-loop renormalization group analysis of the corresponding effective field theory which is explicitly derived by combining a strong-coupling expansion with a replica average over the disorder. The method is applied not only to generic uncorrelated on-site disorder but also to simultaneous hopping disorder correlated with the differences of adjacent disorder potentials. Such correlations are inherent in fine-grained optical speckle potentials used as a source of disorder in optical lattice experiments. As a result of strong coupling, the strength of the replica mixing disorder vertex, responsible for the emergence of a Bose glass, crucially depends on the chemical potential and the Hubbard repulsion and vanishes to leading order in the disorder at commensurate boson fillings. As a consequence, at such fillings a direct transition between the Mott-insulator and the superfluid in the presence of disorder cannot be excluded on the basis of a one-loop calculation. At incommensurate fillings, at a certain length scale, the Mott insulator will eventually become unstable towards the formation of a Boss glass. Phase diagrams as a function of the microscopic parameters are presented and the finite-size crossover between the Mott-insulating state and the Bose glass is analyzed.",cond
30,"Transport in normal-superconductor-normal structures with local
  conservation of current","We study the transport properties of a NSN structure with an insulating barrier at each NS interface. Coherent quasiparticle scattering is assumed and self-consistency is implemented exactly to guarantee local charge conservation. The presence of a finite condensate flow has a greater influence on the transport properties than either the gap depression near the interfaces or the coherent nature of scattering. We find that a nonzero phase gradient causes a shift towards lower voltages of the first peak in the differential conductance and a global enhancement of current. At low currents, we obtain gap profiles near the interfaces that are consistent with the criteria for boundary conditions employed in macroscopic descriptions. The existence of coherent multiple scattering gives rise to a rich structure of resonances that is smoothed out for long superconductors.",cond
31,"Maximally-localized Wannier functions for disordered systems:
  application to amorphous silicon","We use the maximally-localized Wannier function method to study bonding properties in amorphous silicon. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first application of the Wannier-function analysis to a disordered system. Our results show that, in the presence of disorder, this method is extremely helpful in providing an unambiguous picture of the bond distribution. In particular, defect configurations can be studied and characterized with a novel degree of accuracy that was not available before.",cond
32,"Grain boundary component in W-Ga composites: a way towards skeleton
  structures","Nanostructured materials consist of crystalline and grain boundary components. In the simplest case, both components are chemically identical. Here, we present the results of a study of a system consisting of a crystalline component built by A atoms (tungsten) and a grain boundary component of B atoms (gallium). Within this system, component B is in a disordered state. Most likely it exhibits an 'amorphous-like' structure, and coats the tungsten crystals uniformily with a constant thickness, thus forming a Ga skeleton structure. The non-crystalline gallium seems to undergo no first order structural phase transitions, e.g., no first order melting transition was noted when the composit was below, at or above the equilibrium melting point of Ga. The properties of gallium as grain boundary component differ significantly from those of crystalline and amorphous bulk gallium.",cond
33,Nonbackscattering Contribution to the Weak Localization,"We show that the enhancement of backscattering responsible for the weak localization is accompanied by reduction of the scattering in other directions. A simple quasiclassical interpretation of this phenomenon is presented in terms of a small change in the effective differential cross-section for a single impurity. The reduction of the scattering at the arbitrary angles leads to the decrease of the quantum correction to the conductivity. Within the diffusion approximation this decrease is small, but it should be taken into account in the case of a relatively strong magnetic field when the diffusion approximation is not valid.",cond
34,Properties of Phase transitions of a Higher Order,"The following is a thermodynamic analysis of a III order (and some aspects of a IV order) phase transition. Such a transition can occur in a superconductor if the normal state is a diamagnet. The equation for a phase boundary in an H-T (H is the magnetic field, T, the temperature) plane is derived. by considering two possible forms of the gradient energy, it is possible to construct a field theory which describes a III or a IV order transition and permits a study of thermal fluctuations and inhomogeneous order parameters.",cond
35,Non-linear conductivity of charge-density-wave systems,"We consider the problem of sliding motion of a charge-density-wave subject to static disorder within an elastic medium model. Starting with a field-theoretical formulation, which allows exact disorder averaging, we propose a self-consistent approximation scheme to obtain results beyond the standard large-velocity expansion. Explicit calculations are carried out in three spatial dimensions. For the conductivity, we find a strong-coupling regime at electrical fields just above the pinning threshold. Phase and velocity correlation functions scale differently from the high-field regime, and static phase correlations converge to the pinned-phase behaviour. The sliding charge-density-wave is accompanied by narrow-band noise.",cond
36,Non magnetic molecular Jahn-Teller Mott insulators,"Narrow-band conductors may turn insulating and magnetic as a consequence of strong electron-electron correlation. In molecular conductors, the concomitance of a strong Jahn-Teller coupling may give rise to the alternative possibility of a non-magnetic insulator, with or without a static cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion. In the latter case the insulator has Mott-like properties, with an interesting interplay between electron-electron repulsion and the Jahn-Teller effect, which is dynamical. We study this kind of non-magnetic insulator in a very simple $E\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller model and we discuss its general properties in a more general context, also in connection with the insulating state of K_{4}C_{60} and Rb_{4}C_{60}.",cond
37,Universality Classes for Extreme Value Statistics,The low temperature physics of disordered systems is governed by the statistics of extremely low energy states. It is thus rather important to discuss the possible universality classes for extreme value statistics. We compare the usual probabilistic classification to the results of the replica approach. We show in detail that one class of independent variables corresponds exactly to the so-called one step replica symmetry breaking solution in the replica language. This universality class holds if the correlations are sufficiently weak. We discuss the relation between the statistics of extremes and the problem of Burgers turbulence in decay.,cond
38,Excitation Spectra of Circular Few-Electron Quantum Dots,"We study ground states and excited states in semiconductor quantum dots containing 1 to 12 electrons. For the first time, it is possible to identify the quantum numbers of the states in the excitation spectra and make a direct comparison to exact calculations. A magnetic field induces transitions between excited states and ground state. These transitions are discussed in terms of crossings between single-particle states, singlet-triplet transitions, spin polarization, and Hund's rule. Our impurity-free quantum dots allow for atomic physics experiments in magnetic field regimes not accessible for atoms.",cond
39,"Oscillatory shear flow in nanochannels via hybrid particle-continuum
  scheme","This paper provides an application of our hybrid continuum-particle scheme to liquids by considering unsteady shear flows driven by wall oscillations in nano-slots. The particle region (P) adjacent to the wall, is described at the atomistic level by molecular dynamics, while the outer region (C), described by a continuum equation for the transversal momentum, is solved via a finite volume method. Both regions overlap in the ``handshaking'' region where a two-way coupling scheme (C$\to$P and P$\to$C) is implemented. A protocol for the C$\to$P coupling was presented in a previous paper [Delgado-Buscalioni and Coveney, Phys. Rev. E, {\bf 67}, 046704 (2003)]; here we focus on the the P$\to$C counterpart, that is, on the exchange of information from the microscopic to the continuum domain. We first show how to use the finite volume formalism to balance the momentum and mass fluxes across the P$\to$C surface in such a way that the continuity of velocity is ensured. Then we analyse the effect of the fluctuations of the (P) stress tensor on the stability and accuracy of the numerical scheme. This analysis yields a condition which establishes a restriction on the resolution of the flow field that can be described by the hybrid method, in terms of the maximum frequency and wavenumber of the flow.",cond
40,"Search for the πResonance in Two Particle Tunneling Experiments of
  YBCO Superconductors","A recent theory of the resonant neutron scattering peaks in YBCO superconductors predicts the existence of a sharp spin triplet two particle collective mode (the ``\pi resonance"") in the normal state. In this paper, we propose an experiment in which the \pi resonance could be probed directly in a two particle tunneling measurement.",cond
41,"Crossover between Luttinger and Fermi liquid behavior in weakly coupled
  metallic chains","We use higher-dimensional bosonization to study the normal state of electrons in weakly coupled metallic chains interacting with long-range Coulomb forces. Particular attention is paid to the crossover between Luttinger and Fermi liquid behavior as the interchain hopping is varied. Although in the physically interesting case of finite but small interchain hopping the quasi-particle residue does not vanish, the single-particle Green's function exhibits the signature of Luttinger liquid behavior (i.e. anomalous scaling and spin-charge separation) in a large intermediate parameter regime. Using realistic parameters, we find that the scaling behavior in this regime is characterized by an anomalous dimension of the order of unity, as suggested by recent experiments on quasi-one-dimensional conductors. Our calculation gives new insights into the approximations inherent in higher-dimensional bosonization. We also compare our approach with other methods.",cond
42,The Lyapunov Spectrum of a Continuous Product of Random Matrices,"We expose a functional integration method for the averaging of continuous products $\hat{P}_t$ of $N\times N$ random matrices. As an application, we compute exactly the statistics of the Lyapunov spectrum of $\hat{P}_t$. This problem is relevant to the study of the statistical properties of various disordered physical systems, and specifically to the computation of the multipoint correlators of a passive scalar advected by a random velocity field. Apart from these applications, our method provides a general setting for computing statistical properties of linear evolutionary systems subjected to a white noise force field.",cond
43,Metastates in the Hopfield model in the replica symmetric regime,"We study the finite dimensional marginals of the Gibbs measure in the Hopfield model at low temperature when the number of patterns, $M$, is proportional to the volume with a sufficiently small proportionality constant $\a>0$. It is shown that even when a single pattern is selected (by a magnetic field or by conditioning), the marginals do not converge almost surely, but only in law. The corresponding limiting law is constructed explicitly. We fit our result in the recently proposed language of ``metastates'' which we discuss in some length. As a byproduct, in a certain regime of the parameters $\a$ and $\b$ (the inverse temperature), we also give a simple proof of Talagrand's [T1] recent result that the replica symmetric solution found by Amit, Gutfreund, and Sompolinsky [AGS] can be rigorously justified.",cond
44,"Superconducting transition induced by columnar disorder in strong
  magnetic field","The superconducting transition in presence of strong columnar disorder parallel to the magnetic field is considered. A solvable model appropriate for description of the broad crossover regime towards the true ""glassy"" critical behavior is constructed, and the behavior of the thermodynamic quantities and of the Edwards-Anderson order-parameter is obtained. The critical exponents for the correlation lengths orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field are equal and in agreement with the experimental values. The dynamical critical exponent is $z=2$, also in agreement with the measured value. Several perturbations to the solvable model are considered and shown to be irrelevant for the critical behavior. It is argued that there exists an optimal density of defects at which the transition temperature at given magnetic field reaches its maximum.",cond
45,Enhancement of piezoelectricity in a mixed ferroelectric,"We use first-principles density-functional total energy and polarization calculations to calculate the piezoelectric tensor at zero temperature for both cubic and simple tetragonal ordered supercells of Pb_3GeTe_4. The largest piezoelectric coefficient for the tetragonal configuration is enhanced by a factor of about three with respect to that of the cubic configuration. This can be attributed to both the larger strain-induced motion of cations relative to anions and higher Born effective charges in the tetragonal case. A normal mode decomposition shows that both cation ordering and local relaxation weaken the ferroelectric instability, enhancing piezoelectricity.",cond
46,Mixed phases in U(N) superconductivity,"We consider a general class of type-II superconductors which are described by N complex order parameters (OP), with an overall U(N) symmetry for the energy functional. In the lowest energy state, each OP adopts its own particular lattice structure, making the spatial variation of the overall condensate very complex. We present detailed results for the case N=2. We also treat the limit N -> infinity, which allows us to resolve a recent controversy, by showing that all previous studies are fundamentally flawed.",cond
47,"Mechanism of Diamond Nucleation on Titanium Substrate under Very Low
  Pressure","Nucleation and its mechanism of diamond on titanium substrates under very low pressure was studied using hot-filament chemical vapor deposition. Very high nucleation rates and densities (10^8-10^{10} cm^{-2}) were obtained under 1 torr, which were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the counterpart (10^7 cm^{-2}) under conventionally low pressure (tens of torr). The effects of substrate temperature and methane concentration under very low pressure were also investigated, revealing that, overly high substrate temperature leads to a relatively low nucleation density, and that higher CH_4 concentration gives rise to a higher density and a higher rate. The nucleation mechanism is discussed in detail. While a large amount of atomic hydrogen creates nucleating sites, sufficient supersaturation of carbon and/or hydrocarbon species on/near the substrate surface is the key factor for nucleation, in competition against the rapid formation of carbide. Very low pressure leads to long mean free path and other benefiting effects, and hence, is critical for rapid, high-density nucleation. Effects of substrate temperature and CH_4 concentration are also important. This further implies that C_2H_x (x<6) and CH_4 also contribute to nucleation, but CH_{1-3} dominates under very low pressure. The very-low-pressure method seems to be the only candidate to make diamond deposition on titanium films applicable. It also sheds light on how to increase the diamond growth rate.",cond
48,Theoretical search for Chevrel phase based thermoelectric materials,"We investigate the thermoelectric properties of some semiconducting Chevrel phases. Band structure calculations are used to compute thermopowers and to estimate of the effects of alloying and disorder on carrier mobility. Alloying on the Mo site with transition metals like Re, Ru or Tc to reach a semiconducting composition causes large changes in the electronic structure at the Fermi level. Such alloys are expected to have low carrier mobilities.   Filling with transition metals was also found to be incompatible with high thermoelectric performance based on the calculated electronic structures.   Filling with Zn, Cu, and especially with Li was found to be favorable. The calculated electronic structures of these filled Chevrel phases are consistent with low scattering of carriers by defects associated with the filling. We expect good mobility and high thermopower in materials with the composition close to (Li,Cu)$_4$Mo$_6$Se$_8$, particularly when Li-rich, and recommend this system for experimental investigation.",cond
49,Final State Effects in the high q response of $^3$He-$^4$He mixtures,"A modified Gersch-Rodriguez formalism describing the leading Final State Effects in the high momentum transfer response of low concentration $^3$He-$^4$He mixtures is presented and discussed. The leading corrections to the Impulse Approximation are expressed in terms of the interatomic potentials and the semidiagonal two-body density matrices of both the mixture and its boson-boson approximation, in which the $^3$He atoms are replaced by bosons of the same mass and at the same partial density. Numerical calculations of the Final State Effects functions of $^3$He and $^4$He are finally presented and discussed.",cond
50,"General Localization Lengths for Two Interacting Particles in a
  Disordered Chain",The propagation of an interacting particle pair in a disordered chain is characterized by a set of localization lengths which we define. The localization lengths are computed by a new decimation algorithm and provide a more comprehensive picture of the two-particle propagation. We find that the interaction delocalizes predominantly the center-of-mass motion of the pair and use our approach to propose a consistent interpretation of the discrepancies between previous numerical results.,cond
51,"Long-range-interactions induced ordered structures in deposition
  processes","We present a new model of sequential adsorption in which the adsorbing particles experience dipolar interactions. We show that in the presence of these long-range interactions, highly ordered structures in the adsorbed layer may be induced at low temperatures. The new phenomenology manifests through significant variations of the pair correlation function and the jamming limit, with respect to the case of noninteracting particles. Our study could be relevant in understanding the adsorption of magnetic colloidal particles in presence of a magnetic field.",cond
52,Fractional pumping of energy into a ballistic quantum ring,"We consider the energy stored in a one-dimensional ballistic ring with a barrier subject to a linearly time-dependent magnetic flux. An exact analytic solution for the quantum dynamics of electrons in the ring is found for the case when the electro-motive force ${\cal E}$ is much smaller than the level spacing, $\Delta$. Electron states exponentially localized in energy are found for irrational values of the ratio $A\equiv\Delta/2e{\cal E}$. Relaxation limits the dynamic evolution and localization does not develop if $A$ is sufficiently close to a rational number. As a result the accumulated energy becomes a regular function of $A$ containing a set of sharp peaks at rational values (fractional pumping). The shape of the peaks and the distances between them are governed by the interplay between the strength of backscattering and the relaxation rate.",cond
53,"Clock shifts in a Fermi gas interacting with a minority component: a
  soluble model","We consider the absorption spectrum of a Fermi gas mixed with a minority species when majority fermions are transferred to another internal state by an external probe. In the limit when the minority species is much more massive than the majority one, we show that the minority species may be treated as static impurities and the problem can be solved in closed form. The analytical results bring out the importance of vertex corrections, which change qualitatively the nature of the absorption spectrum. It is demonstrated that large line shifts are not associated with resonant interactions in general. We also show that the commonly used ladder approximation fails when the majority component is degenerate for large mass ratios between the minority and majority species and that bubble diagrams, which correspond to the creation of many particle--hole pairs, must be taken into account. We carry out detailed numerical calculations, which confirm the analytical insights and we point out the connection to shadowing phenomena in nuclear physics.",cond
54,"Generalized nonpolynomial Schrodinger equations for matter waves under
  anisotropic transverse confinement","Starting from the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation we derive a 1D generalized nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation, which describes the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates under the action of a generic potential in the longitudinal axial direction and of an anisotropic harmonic potential in the transverse radial direction. This equation reduces to the familiar 1D nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation [Phys. Rev. A 65, 043614 (2002)] in the case of isotropic transverse harmonic confinement. In addition, we show that if the longitudinal potential models a periodic optical lattice the 3D GPE can be mapped into a 1D generalized discrete nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation.",cond
55,"Study of the Phase Diagram and the Tc Pressure Dependence for HgBaCuO
  Superconductors",We apply a method recently derived based on the extended Hubbard Hamiltonian and the BCS approach to obtain the superconducting critical temperature dependence with carrier density for the HgBaCuO compounds. We show that this procedure can be used to study pressure effect with the assumption that pressure changes the supercondutor gap. The results reproduce well the experimental data for the whole doping regime and the high and low pressure dependence.,cond
56,Random walk on disordered networks,"Random walks are studied on disordered cellular networks in 2-and 3-dimensional spaces with arbitrary curvature. The coefficients of the evolution equation are calculated in term of the structural properties of the cellular system. The effects of disorder and space-curvature on the diffusion phenomena are investigated. In disordered systems the mean square displacement displays an enhancement at short time and a lowering at long ones, with respect to the ordered case. The asymptotic expression for the diffusion equation on hyperbolic cellular systems relates random walk on curved lattices to hyperbolic Brownian motion.",cond
57,Atomic quantum dots coupled to BEC reservoirs,"We study the dynamics of an atomic quantum dot, i.e. a single atom in a tight optical trap which is coupled to a superfluid reservoir via laser transitions. Quantum interference between the collisional interactions and the laser induced coupling to the phase fluctuations of the condensate results in a tunable coupling of the dot to a dissipative phonon bath, allowing an essentially complete decoupling from the environment. Quantum dots embedded in a 1D Luttinger liquid of cold bosonic atoms realize a spin-Boson model with ohmic coupling, which exhibits a dissipative phase transition and allows to directly measure atomic Luttinger parameters.",cond
58,"Beyond the Thomas-Fermi approximation for a trapped condensed
  Bose-Einstein gas","Corrections to the zero-temperature Thomas-Fermi description of a dilute interacting condensed Bose-Einstein gas confined in an isotropic harmonic trap arise due to the presence of a boundary layer near the condensate surface. Within the Bogoliubov approximation, the various contributions to the ground-state condensate energy all have terms of order R^{-4}ln R and R^{-4}, where R is the number-dependent dimensionless condensate radius in units of the oscillator length. The zero-order hydrodynamic density-fluctuation amplitudes are extended beyond the Thomas-Fermi radius through the boundary layer to provide a uniform description throughout all space. The first-order correction to the excitation frequencies is shown to be of order R^{-4}.",cond
59,"Resonant Tunneling and Persistent Current of a Non-interacting and
  Weakly Interacting One-dimensional Electron Gas","The persistent current for a one-dimensional ring with two tunnel barriers is considered in the limit of weakly interacting electrons. In addition to a small off-resonance current, there are two kinds of resonant behavior; (i) a current independent of the barrier transparency (true resonance) and (ii) a current analogous to the one for a ring with only a single barrier (``semi''-resonance). For a given barrier transparency one or the other type of resonant behavior is realized depending on a geometric factor (ratio of interbarrier distance to ring circumference) and on the strength of the electron-electron interaction. It is shown that a repulsive interaction favours the``semi''-resonance behavior. For a small barrier transparency the ``semi''-resonance peaks are easily washed out by temperature whereas the true resonance peaks survive.",cond
60,``Bare'' Effective Mass in Finite Sized $ν= 1/2$ Systems,"In this note, we discuss the effective mass of quasiparticles in finite sized $\nu = 1/2$ systems in the lowest Landau level, given a natural notion we have of the Fermi surface in these finite sized systems. The effective mass is related to the difference between instantaneous density-density response functions of the ground state and excited states of the system; we do a finite size calculation for this difference for $\nu = 1/2$ systems with 7, 8 and 9 fermions, and conjecture how the difference must look in the thermodynamic limit.",cond
61,Nanometer Scale Dielectric Fluctuations at the Glass Transition,"Using non-contact scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, dielectric properties were studied on 50 nanometer length scales in poly-vinyl-acetate (PVAc) films in the vicinity of the glass transition. Low frequency (1/f) noise observed in the measurements, was shown to arise from thermal fluctuations of the electric polarization. Anomalous variations observed in the noise spectrum provide direct evidence for cooperative nano-regions with heterogeneous kinetics. The cooperative length scale was determined. Heterogeneity was long-lived only well below the glass transition for faster than average processes.",cond
62,Threading dislocation lines in two-sided flux array decorations,"Two-sided flux decoration experiments indicate that threading dislocation lines (TDLs), which cross the entire film, are sometimes trapped in metastable states. We calculate the elastic energy associated with the meanderings of a TDL. The TDL behaves as an anisotropic and dispersive string with thermal fluctuations largely along its Burger's vector. These fluctuations also modify the structure factor of the vortex solid. Both effects can in principle be used to estimate the elastic moduli of the material.",cond
63,"An Interpretation of the Neutron Scattering Data on Flux Lattices of
  Superconductors","Small angle neutron diffraction experiments are analyzed using recently developed and properly generalized one-field effective free energy method. In the case of experiment of Keimer et al on YBCO, we show that the fourfold symmetry of the underlying crystal is explicitly broken, but the reflection with respect to the [110] and [1\={1}0] axes remains a symmetry. The vortex lattice also becomes generally oblique instead of rectangular body centered. Unexpectedly rich phase diagram is described.",cond
64,Quasiparticle Many-Body Dynamics of Highly Correlated Electronic Systems,"The self-consistent theory of the correlation effects in Highly Correlated Systems(HCS) is presented. The novel Irreducible Green's Functions(IGF) method is discused in detail for the Hubbard model and random Hubbard model. The interpolative solution for the quasiparticle spectrum, which is valid for both the atomic and band limit is obtained. The (IGF) method permits to calculate the quasiparticle spectra of many-particle systems with the complicated spectra and strong interaction in a very natural and compact way. The inelastic scattering corrections leads to the damping of the quasiparticles and are the main topic of the present consideration. The calculation of the damping has been done in a self-consistent way for both limits. For the random Hubbard model the weak coupling case has been considered and the self-energy operator has been calculated using the combination of the IGF method and Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA). The other applications of the method to s-f model, Anderson model, Heisenberg antiferromagnet, electron-phonon interaction models are discussed briefly.",cond
65,Diffusion of Pt dimers on Pt(111),"We report the results of a density-functional study of the diffusion of Pt dimers on the (111) surface of Pt. The calculated activation energy of 0.37 eV is in {\em exact} agreement with the recent experiment of Kyuno {\em et al.} \protect{[}Surf. Sci. {\bf 397}, 191 (1998)\protect{]}. Our calculations establish that the dimers are mobile at temperatures of interest for adatom diffusion, and thus contribute to mass transport. They also indicate that the diffusion path for dimers consists of a sequence of one-atom and (concerted) two-atom jumps.",cond
66,"Variational ansatz for the nonlinear Landau-Zener problem for cold atom
  association","We present a rigorous analysis of the Landau-Zener linear-in-time term crossing problem for quadratic-nonlinear systems relevant to the coherent association of ultracold atoms in degenerate quantum gases. Our treatment is based on an exact third-order nonlinear differential equation for the molecular state probability. Applying a variational two-term ansatz, we construct a simple approximation that accurately describes the whole-time dynamics of coupled atom-molecular system for any set of involved parameters. Ensuring an absolute error less than for the final transition probability, the resultant solution improves by several orders of magnitude the accuracy of the previous approximations by A. Ishkhanyan et al. developed separately for the weak coupling [J. Phys. A 38, 3505 (2005)] and strong interaction [J. Phys. A 39, 14887 (2006)] limits. In addition, the constructed approximation covers the whole moderate-coupling regime, providing for this intermediate regime the same accuracy as for the two mentioned limits. The obtained results reveal the remarkable observation that for the strong-coupling limit the resonance crossing is mostly governed by the nonlinearity, while the coherent atom-molecular oscillations arising soon after the resonance has been crossed are basically of linear nature. This observation is supposed to be of a general character due to the basic attributes of the resonance crossing processes in the nonlinear quantum systems of the discussed type of involved quadratic nonlinearity.",cond
67,Triangular avalanches and uphill instabilities,"Recent experiments show that an avalanche initiated from a point source propagates downwards by invading a triangular shaped region. The opening angle of this triangle appears to reach 180$^o$ for a critical inclination of the pile, beyond which avalanches also propage upwards. We propose a simple interpretation of these observations, based on an extension of a phenomenological model for surface flows.",cond
68,"Solution of effective Hamiltonian of impurity hopping between two sites
  in a metal","We analyze in detail all the possible fixed points of the effective Hamiltonian of a non-magnetic impurity hopping between two sites in a metal obtained by Moustakas and Fisher(MF). We find a line of non-fermi liquid fixed points which continuously interpolates between the 2-channel Kondo fixed point(2CK) and the one channel, two impurity Kondo (2IK) fixed point. The additional non-fermi liquid fixed point found by MF has the same symmetry as the 2IK, The system is shown to flow to a line of fermi-liquid fixed points which continuously interpolates between the non-interacting fixed point and the 2 channel spin-flavor Kondo fixed point (2CSFK) discussed by the author previously. The effect of particle-hole symmetry breaking is discussed. The effective Hamiltonian in the external magnetic field is analysed. The scaling functions for the physical measurable quantities are derived in the different regimes; their predictions for the experiments are given. Finally the implications are given for a non-magnetic impurity hopping around three sites with triangular symmetry discussed by MF.",cond
69,"The Role of Density of States Fluctuations in the Normal State
  Properties of High Tc Superconductors","HTS show many puzzling anomalies in their normal state properties. Among them are:   - the presence of a peak in the c-axis resistance and its growth in external magnetic field   - the anomalous negative magnetoresistance observed above Tc   - the deviation from the Korringa law in the temperature dependence of the NMR relaxation rate   - the opening of a large pseudo-gap in the c-axis optical conductivity well above Tc   - the gap-like tunneling anomalies observed above Tc   - the anomalies in the thermoelectric power above Tc   We show how all these effects can be explained by the enhanced role played in quasi-2D systems by the fluctuation decrease of the one-electron density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, and its competition with other fluctuation contributions (AL, MT). The full fluctuation theory in HTS is reviewed and its resuls compared with experimental data.",cond
70,Counting Individual Electrons on Liquid Helium,"We show that small numbers of electrons, including a single electron, can be held in a novel electrostatic trap above the surface of superfluid helium. A potential well is created using microfabricated electrodes in a 5 micron diameter pool of helium. Electrons are injected into the trap from an electron reservoir on a helium microchannel. They are individually detected using a superconducting single-electron transistor (SET) as an electrometer. A Coulomb staircase is observed as electrons leave the trap one-by-one until the trap is empty. A design for a scalable quantum information processor using arrays of electron traps is presented",cond
71,"Time scale separation and heterogeneous off-equilibrium dynamics in spin
  models over random graphs","We study analytically and numerically the statics and the off-equilibrium dynamics of spin models over finitely connected random graphs. We identify a threshold value for the connectivity beyond which the loop structure of the graph becomes thermodynamically relevant. Glauber dynamics simulations show that this loop structure is responsible for the onset of dynamical features of a local character (dynamical heterogeneities and spontaneous time scale separation), consistently with previous (experimental and numerical) studies of glasses and spin glasses in their approach to the low temperature phase.",cond
72,Harmonic oscillators in the Nosé - Hoover thermostat,"We study the dynamics of an ensemble of non-interacting harmonic oscillators in a nonlinear dissipative environment described by the Nos\'e - Hoover model. Using numerical simulation we find the histogram for total energy, which agrees with the analysis of the Nos\'e - Hoover equations effected with the method of averaging. The histogram does not correspond to Gibbs' canonical distribution. We have found oscillations at frequency proportional to $\sqrt{\alpha/m}$, $\alpha$ the dissipative parameter of thermostat and $m$ the characteristic mass of particle, about the stationary state corresponding to equilibrium. The oscillations could have an important bearing upon the analysis of simulating molecular dynamics in the Nos\'e - Hoover thermostat.",cond
73,"Universal scaling in BCS superconductivity in three dimensions in
  non-$s$ waves","The solutions of a renormalized BCS equation are studied in three space dimensions in $s$, $p$ and $d$ waves for finite-range separable potentials in the weak to medium coupling region. In the weak-coupling limit, the present BCS model yields a small coherence length $\xi$ and a large critical temperature, $T_c$, appropriate for some high-$T_c$ materials. The BCS gap, $T_c$, $\xi$ and specific heat $C_s(T_c)$ as a function of zero-temperature condensation energy are found to exhibit potential-independent universal scalings. The entropy, specific heat, spin susceptibility and penetration depth as a function of temperature exhibit universal scaling below $T_c$ in $p$ and $d$ waves.",cond
74,"Universality of the Wigner time delay distribution for one-dimensional
  random potentials","We show that the distribution of the time delay for one-dimensional random potentials is universal in the high energy or weak disorder limit. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with extensive numerical simulations carried out on samples whose sizes are large compared to the localisation length (localised regime). The case of small samples is also discussed (ballistic regime). We provide a physical argument which explains in a quantitative way the origin of the exponential divergence of the moments. The occurence of a log-normal tail for finite size systems is analysed. Finally, we present exact results in the low energy limit which clearly show a departure from the universal behaviour.",cond
75,On the Nature of Spin Currents,"Full expressions for finite frequency spin and charge conductivity in Rashba and Luttinger type systems are given. Whereas in the Rashba Hamiltonian the spin conductivity has the same frequency dependence as the dielectric polarizability, the Luttinger case is different. Moreover, for a generalized Rashba-type coupling the two quantities also exhibit different frequency dependencies.",cond
76,Phase Diagrams for Spin-1 Bosons in an Optical Lattice,"In this paper, the phase diagrams of a polar spin-1 Bose gas in a three-dimensional optical lattice with linear and quadratic Zeeman effects both at zero and finite temperatures are obtained within mean-field theory. The phase diagrams can be regrouped to two different parameter regimes depending on the magnitude of the quadratic Zeeman effect $Q$. For large $Q$, only a first-order phase transition from the nematic (NM) phase to the fully magnetic (FM) phase is found, while in the case of small $Q$, a first-order phase transition from the nematic phase to the partially magnetic (PM) phase, plus a second-order phase transition from the PM phase to the FM phase is obtained. If a net magnetization in the system exists, the first-order phase transition causes a coexistence of two phases and phase separation: for large $Q$, NM and FM phases and for small $Q$, NM and PM phases. The phase diagrams in terms of net magnetization are also obtained.",cond
77,"Post-growth annealing of GaMnAs under As capping - an alternative way to

78,"Vortex nucleation as a case study of symmetry breaking in quantum
  systems","Mean-field methods are a very powerful tool for investigating weakly interacting many-body systems in many branches of physics. In particular, they describe with excellent accuracy trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. A generic, but difficult question concerns the relation between the symmetry properties of the true many-body state and its mean-field approximation. Here, we address this question by considering, theoretically, vortex nucleation in a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate. A slow sweep of the rotation frequency changes the state of the system from being at rest to the one containing one vortex. Within the mean-field framework, the jump in symmetry occurs through a turbulent phase around a certain critical frequency. The exact many-body ground state at the critical frequency exhibits strong correlations and entanglement. We believe that this constitutes a paradigm example of symmetry breaking in - or change of the order parameter of - quantum many-body systems in the course of adiabatic evolution.",cond
79,Casimir forces in binary liquid mixtures,If two ore more bodies are immersed in a critical fluid critical fluctuations of the order parameter generate long ranged forces between these bodies. Due to the underlying mechanism these forces are close analogues of the well known Casimir forces in electromagnetism. For the special case of a binary liquid mixture near its critical demixing transition confined to a simple parallel plate geometry it is shown that the corresponding critical Casimir forces can be of the same order of magnitude as the dispersion (van der Waals) forces between the plates. In wetting experiments or by direct measurements with an atomic force microscope the resulting modification of the usual dispersion forces in the critical regime should therefore be easily detectable. Analytical estimates for the Casimir amplitudes Delta in d=4-epsilon are compared with corresponding Monte-Carlo results in d=3 and their quantitative effect on the thickness of critical wetting layers and on force measurements is discussed.,cond
80,"Rotating wave approximation: systematic expansion and application to
  coupled spin pairs","We propose a new treatment of the dynamics of a periodically time-dependent Liouvillian by mapping it onto a time-independent problem and give a systematic expansion for its effective Liouvillian. In the case of a two-level system, the lowest order contribution is equivalent to the well-known rotating wave approximation. We extend the formalism to a pair of coupled two-level systems. For this pair, we find two Rabi frequencies and we can give parameter regimes where the leading order of the expansion is suppressed and higher orders become important. These results might help to investigate the interaction of tunneling systems in mixed crystals by providing a tool for the analysis of echo experiments.",cond
81,"Josephson tunnelling of a phase-imprinted Bose-Einstein condensate in a
  time-dependent double-well potential","This paper discusses the feasibility of experimental control of the flow direction of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a double-well potential using phase-imprinting. The flow is induced by the application of a time-dependent potential gradient, providing a clear signature of macroscopic quantum tunneling in atomic condensates. By studying both initial state preparation and subsequent tunneling dynamics we find the parameters to optimise the phase induced Josephson current. We find that the effect is largest for condensates up to a few thousand atoms, and is only weakly-dependent on trap geometry.",cond
82,"A theoretical analysis of Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy:
  k-space distributions and spectroscopy","We analyze BEEM experiments. At low temperatures and low voltages, near the threshold value of the Schottky barrier, the BEEM current is dominated by the elastic component. Elastic scattering by the lattice results in the formation of focused beams and narrow lines in real space. To obtain the current injected in the semiconductor, we compute the current distribution in reciprocal space and, assuming energy and $k_{\parallel}$ conservation. Our results show an important focalization of the injected electron beam and explain the similarity between BEEM currents for Au/Si(111) and Au/Si(100).",cond
83,Dynamical signatures of the vulcanization transition,"Dynamical properties of vulcanized polymer networks are addressed via a Rouse-type model that incorporates the effect of permanent random crosslinks. The incoherent intermediate scattering function is computed in the sol and gel phases, and at the vulcanization transition between them. At any nonzero crosslink density within the sol phase Kohlrausch relaxation is found. The critical point is signalled by divergence of the longest time-scale, and at this point the scattering function decays algebraically, whereas within the gel phase it acquires a time-persistent part identified with the gel fraction.",cond
84,"Magnetoresistance of a two-dimensional electron gas with spatially
  periodic lateral modulations: Exact consequences of Boltzmann's equation","On the basis of Boltzmann's equation, and including anisotropic scattering in the collision operator, we investigate the effect of one-dimensional superlattices on two-dimensional electron systems. In addition to superlattices defined by static electric and magnetic fields, we consider mobility superlattices describing a spatially modulated density of scattering centers. We prove that magnetic and electric superlattices in $x$-direction affect only the resistivity component $\rho_{xx}$ if the mobility is homogeneous, whereas a mobility lattice in $x$-direction in the absence of electric and magnetic modulations affects only $\rho_{yy}$. Solving Boltzmann's equation numerically, we calculate the positive magnetoresistance in weak magnetic fields and the Weiss oscillations in stronger fields within a unified approach.",cond

86,Strong coupling theory of impure superconductors : real space formalism,"In the electron-phonon model, the influence of nonmagnetic impurities on the transition temperature of superconductors is revisited. Anderson's pairing condition between time-reversed eigenstate pairs is derived from the physical constraint of the Anomalous Green's function. After this pairing condition is incorporated into the self-consistency equation, one may find that the phonon-mediated interaction decreases exponentially by localization.",cond
87,Self similar Barkhausen noise in magnetic domain wall motion,"A model for domain wall motion in ferromagnets is analyzed. Long-range magnetic dipolar interactions are shown to give rise to self-similar dynamics when the external magnetic field is increased adiabatically.

88,Magnetism and Superconductivity in (RE)Ni2B2C: The Case of TmNi2B2C,"The recently reported coexistence of an oscillatory magnetic order with the wave vector Q=0.241 \AA^{-1} and superconductivity in TmNi2B2C is analyzed theoretically. It is shown that the oscillatory magnetic order and superconductivity interact predominantly via the exchange interaction between localized moments (LM's) and conduction electrons, while the electromagnetic interaction between them is negligible. In the coexistence phase of the clean TmNi2B2C the quasiparticle spectrum should have a line of zeros at the Fermi surface, giving rise to the power law behavior of thermodynamic and transport properties. Two scenarios of the origin of the oscillatory magnetic order in TmNi2B2C are analyzed: a) due to superconductivity and b) independently on superconductivity. Experiments in magnetic field are proposed in order to choose between them.",cond

  Systems","We have developed an ensemble density functional theory which includes spin degrees of freedom for nonuniform quantum Hall systems. We have applied this theory using a local-spin-density approximation to study the edge reconstruction of parabolically confined quantum dots. For a Zeeman splitting below a certain critical value, the edge of completely polarized maximum density droplet reconstructs into a spin-unpolarized structure. For larger Zeeman splittings, the edge remains polarized and develops an exchange hole.",cond

  Angle Resolved Photoemission","In this paper, we review some of the work our group has done in the past few years to obtain the electron self-energy of high temperature superconductors by analysis of angle-resolved photoemission data. We focus on three examples which have revealed: (1) a d-wave superconducting gap, (2) a collective mode in the superconducting state, and (3) pairing correlations in the pseudogap phase. In each case, although a novel result is obtained which captures the essense of the data, the conventional physics used leads to an incomplete picture. This indicates that new physics needs to be developed to obtain a proper understanding of these materials.",cond

In particular, at $T_c$ the screening length assumes the universal value $L_z\Lambda_{T_c}/2\nu_s$ predicted by the Kosterlitz-Thouless theory, which indicates that binding of long vortex strings nucleates long-range superconductivity in the present samples containing up to $10^5$ CuO$_2$-layers. Several details of the order-parameter dynamics remain unexplained.",cond
94,"A Hermite-Padé perspective on Gell-Mann--Low renormalization group: an
  application to the correlation function of Lieb-Liniger gas","While Pad\'e approximation is a general method for improving convergence of series expansions, Gell-Mann--Low renormalization group normally relies on the presence of special symmetries. We show that in the single-variable case, the latter becomes an integral Hermite-Pad\'e approximation, needing no special symmetries. It is especially useful for interpolating between expansions for small values of a variable and a scaling law of known exponent for large values. As an example, we extract the scaling-law prefactor for the one-body density matrix of the Lieb-Liniger gas. Using a new result for the 4th-order term in the short-distance expansion, we find a remarkable agreement with known ab initio numerical results.",cond

97,Depinning of a domain wall in the 2d random-field Ising model,"We report studies of the behaviour of a single driven domain wall in the 2-dimensional non-equilibrium zero temperature random-field Ising model, closely above the depinning threshold. It is found that even for very weak disorder, the domain wall moves through the system in percolative fashion. At depinning, the fraction of spins that are flipped by the proceeding avalanche vanishes with the same exponent beta=5/36 as the infinite percolation cluster in percolation theory. With decreasing disorder strength, however, the size of the critical region decreases. Our numerical simulation data appear to reflect a crossover behaviour to an exponent beta'=0 at zero disorder strength. The conclusions of this paper strongly rely on analytical arguments. A scaling theory in terms of the disorder strength and the magnetic field is presented that gives the values of all critical exponent except for one, the value of which is estimated from scaling arguments.",cond
98,"Spin-Orbit-Induced Magnetic Anisotropy for Impurities in Metallic
  Samples I. Surface Anisotropy","Motivated by the recent measurements of Kondo resistivity in thin films and wires, where the Kondo amplitude is suppressed for thinner samples, the surface anisotropy for magnetic impurities is studied. That anisotropy is developed in those cases where in addition to the exchange interaction with the impurity there is strong spin-orbit interaction for conduction electrons around the impurity in the ballistic region. The asymmetry in the neighborhood of the magnetic impurity exhibits the anisotropy axis $n$ which, in the case of a plane surface, is perpendicular to the surface. The anisotropy energy is $\Delta E=K_d (nS)^2$ for spin $S$, and the anisotropy constant $K_d$ is inversionally proportional to distance $d$ measured from the surface and $K_d>0$. Thus at low temperature the spin is frozen in a singlet or doublet of lowest energy. The influence of that anisotropy on the electrical resistivity is the subject of the following paper (part II).",cond
99,"Novel Collective Excitation in Spin Textured Edges of Quantum Hall
  Systems","We study the electric and magnetic properties of the edge of a two-dimensional electron gas in presence of a magnetic field and at filling factor unity. The existence of a spin textured edge is proved as a function of the Zeeman coupling and of the smoothness of the confining potential. We also calculate the low energy excitation of the spin textured phase. We obtain that in addition to the classical edge magnetoplasmons at small wavectors, there is an almost dispersionless excitation, with a finite gap of energy at zero wavevector. This excitation is associated with the broken symmetry of the spin textured edge phase.",cond
100,Anomalous dynamical scaling and bifractality in the 1D Anderson model,"We investigate dynamical scaling properties of the 1D tight-binding Anderson model with a weak diagonal disorder, by means of the spreading of a wave packet. In the absence of disorder, and more generally in the ballistic regime, the wavefunction exhibits sharp fronts. These ballistic fronts yield an anomalous time dependence of the $q$-th moment of the local probability density, or dynamical participation number of order $q$, with a non-trivial exponent $\tau(q)$ for $q>2$. This striking feature is interpreted as bifractality. A heuristic treatment of the localised regime demonstrates a similar anomalous scaling, but with the correlation length $\xi_0$ near the band center replacing time. The moments of the position of the particle are not affected by the fronts, and they exhibit normal scaling. The crossover behaviour of all these quantities between the ballistic and the localised regime is described by scaling functions of one single variable, $x=t/\xi_0$. These predictions are confirmed by accurate numerical data, both in the normal and in the anomalous case.",cond
101,Physics with Coherent Matter Waves,"This review discusses progress in the new field of coherent matter waves, in particular with respect to Bose-Einstein condensates. We give a short introduction to Bose-Einstein condensation and the theoretical description of the condensate wavefunction. We concentrate on the coherence properties of this new type of matter wave as a basis for fundamental physics and applications. The main part of this review treats various measurements and concepts in the physics with coherent matter waves. In particular we present phase manipulation methods, atom lasers, nonlinear atom optics, optical elements, interferometry and physics in optical lattices. We give an overview of the state of the art in the respective fields and discuss achievements and challenges for the future.",cond
102,"Entropically driven reentrant SmC-SmA-SmC phase transition in composite
  polymer--liquid crystal systems","I consider the effects of polymers on the smectic phase of a host liquid crystal matrix. Focusing on the regime in which the polymers are predominately confined between the smectic layers, I find that the presence of the polymers can lead to a reentrant phase diagram with the smectic-C sandwiching the smectic-A phase from both the high and low temperature sides. Simple entropy-energy arguments predict the shape of the reentrant phase boundary.",cond
103,Crossovers and Phase Coherence in Cuprate Superconductors,"High temperature superconductivity is a property of doped antiferromagnetic insulators. The electronic structure is inhomogeneous on short length and time scales, and, as the temperature decreases, it evolves via two crossovers, before long range superconducting order is achieved. Except for overdoped materials, pairing and phase coherence occur at different temperatures, and phase fluctuations determine both T$_c$ and the temperature dependence of the superfluid density for a wide range of doping. A mechanism for obtaining a high pairing scale in a short coherence length material with a strong poorly-screened Coulomb interaction is described.",cond
104,Gel transitions in colloidal suspensions,"The idealized mode coupling theory (MCT) is applied to colloidal systems interacting via short-range attractive interactions of Yukawa form. At low temperatures MCT predicts a slowing down of the local dynamics and ergodicity breaking transitions. The nonergodicity transitions share many features with the colloidal gel transition, and are proposed to be the source of gelation in colloidal systems. Previous calculations of the phase diagram are complemented with additional data for shorter ranges of the attractive interaction, showing that the path of the nonergodicity transition line is then unimpeded by the gas-liquid critical curve at low temperatures. Particular attention is given to the critical nonergodicity parameters, motivated by recent experimental measurements. An asymptotic model is developed, valid for dilute systems of spheres interacting via strong short-range attractions, and is shown to capture all aspects of the low temperature MCT nonergodicity transitions.",cond
105,"Universal Linear Density of States for Tunneling into the
  Two-Dimensional Electron Gas in a Magnetic field","A new technique permits high fidelity measurement of the tunneling density of states (TDOS) of the two-dimensional electron gas. The obtained TDOS contains no distortions arising from low 2D in-plane conductivity and includes the contribution from localized tunneling sites. In a perpendicular magnetic field, a pseudogap develops in the TDOS at the Fermi level. Improved sensitivity enables resolution of a linear dependence of the TDOS on energy near the Fermi energy. The slopes of this linear gap are strongly field dependent. The data are suggestive of a new model of the gap at low energies.",cond
106,Bose-Einstein condensation in a magnetic double-well potential,"We present the first experimental realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation in a purely magnetic double-well potential. This has been realised by combining a static Ioffe-Pritchard trap with a time orbiting potential (TOP). The double trap can be rapidly switched to a single harmonic trap of identical oscillation frequencies thus accelerating the two condensates towards each other. Furthermore, we show that time averaged potentials can be used as a means to control the radial confinement of the atoms. Manipulation of the radial confinement allows vortices and radial quadrupole oscillations to be excited.",cond
107,Domain Statistics in Coarsening Systems,"We study the domain number and size distributions in the one-dimensional Ising and $q$-state Potts models subject to zero-temperature Glauber dynamics. The survival probability of a domain, $S(t)\sim t^{-\psi}$, and an unreacted domain, $Q_1(t)\sim t^{-\delta}$, are characterized by two independent nonrtrivial exponents. For the Ising case, we find $\psi=0.126$ and $\delta=1.27$ using numerical simulations. We develop an independent interval approximation (IIA) that predicts the qualitative behavior of the domain distribution and provides good estimates for the exponents. Exact results for the domain distribution are also obtained in several solvable cases.",cond
108,Sandpiles on fractal bases: pile shape and phase segregation,"Sandpiles have become paradigmatic systems for granular flow studies in statistical physics. New directions of investigations are discussed here. Rather than varying the nature of the pile (sand, salt, rice,..) we have investigated changes in the boundary conditions. We have investigated experimentally and numerically sandpile structures on bases having a fractal perimeter. This type of perimeter induces the formation of a quite complex set of ridges and valleys. A screening effect of the valleys is observed and depends on the angle of repose. Binary granular systems have also been investigated on such bases: a spectacular demixing is obtained along the valleys. This type of phase segregation is discussed with respect to numerical studies.",cond
109,"Coulomb blockade threshold in inhomogeneous one-dimensional arrays of
  tunnel junctions","A general expression is given for the change in free energy when a charge tunnels through a junction in a one-dimensional array of N metallic islands with arbitrary capacitances and arbitrary background charges. This is used to obtain expressions for the (average) threshold voltage of the Coulomb blockade for a few characteristic geometries. We find that including random background charges has a large effect on the N-dependence of the threshold voltage: In an array with identical junction capacitances C and gate capacitances C_g, the threshold voltage, averaged over the background charge, is proportional to N^a, where {a} crosses over from 1/2 to 1 when N becomes larger than 2.5\sqrt{C/C_g}.",cond
110,"Damage spreading transition in glasses: a probe for the ruggedness of
  the configurational landscape",We consider damage spreading transitions in the framework of mode-coupling theory. This theory describes relaxation processes in glasses in the mean-field approximation which are known to be characterized by the presence of an exponentially large number of meta-stable states. For systems evolving under identical but arbitrarily correlated noises we demonstrate that there exists a critical temperature $T_0$ which separates two different dynamical regimes depending on whether damage spreads or not in the asymptotic long-time limit. This transition exists for generic noise correlations such that the zero damage solution is stable at high-temperatures being minimal for maximal noise correlations. Although this dynamical transition depends on the type of noise correlations we show that the asymptotic damage has the good properties of an dynamical order parameter such as: 1) Independence on the initial damage; 2) Independence on the class of initial condition and 3) Stability of the transition in the presence of asymmetric interactions which violate detailed balance. For maximally correlated noises we suggest that damage spreading occurs due to the presence of a divergent number of saddle points (as well as meta-stable states) in the thermodynamic limit consequence of the ruggedness of the free energy landscape which characterizes the glassy state. These results are then compared to extensive numerical simulations of a mean-field glass model (the Bernasconi model) with Monte Carlo heat-bath dynamics. The freedom of choosing arbitrary noise correlations for Langevin dynamics makes damage spreading a interesting tool to probe the ruggedness of the configurational landscape.,cond
111,"One-parameter Superscaling at the Metal-Insulator Transition in Three
  Dimensions","Based on the spectral statistics obtained in numerical simulations on three dimensional disordered systems within the tight--binding approximation, a new superuniversal scaling relation is presented that allows us to collapse data for the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry ($\beta=1,2,4$) onto a single scaling curve. This relation provides a strong evidence for one-parameter scaling existing in these systems which exhibit a second order phase transition. As a result a possible one-parameter family of spacing distribution functions, $P_g(s)$, is given for each symmetry class $\beta$, where $g$ is the dimensionless conductance.",cond
112,Parallel Quantum-Point-Contacts as High-Frequency-Mixers,"We present the results of high-frequency mixing experiments performed upon parallel quantum point-contacts defined in the two-dimensional electron gas of an Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As/GaAs-heterostructure. The parallel geometry, fabricated using a novel double-resist technology, enables the point-contact device to be impedance matched over a wide frequency range and, in addition, increases the power levels of the mixing signal while simultaneously reducing the parasitic source-drain capacitance. Here, we consider two parallel quantum point-contact devices with 155 and 110 point-contacts respectively; both devices operated successfully at liquid helium and liquid nitrogen temperatures with a minimal conversion loss of 13 dB.",cond
113,Microwave-induced Fano-Feshbach resonances,"We investigate the possibility to control the s-wave scattering length for the interaction between cold bosonic atoms by using a microwave field. Our scheme applies to any atomic species with a ground state that is split by hyperfine interaction. We discuss more specifically the case of alkali-metal atoms and calculate the change in the scattering length for 7Li, 23Na, 41K, 87Rb, and 133Cs. Our results yield optimistic prospects for experiments with the four latter species.",cond
114,Traffic by small teams of molecular motors,"Molecular motors transport various cargos along cytoskeletal filaments, analogous to trucks on roads. In contrast to vehicles, however, molecular motors do not work alone but in small teams. We describe a simple model for the transport of a cargo by one team of motors and by two teams of motors, which walk into opposite directions. The cooperation of one team of motors generates long-range transport, which we observed experimentally in vitro. Transport by two teams of motors leads to a variety of bidirectional motility behaviour and to dynamic instabilities reminiscent of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also discuss how cargo transport by teams of motors allows the cell to generate robust long-range bidirectional transport.",cond
115,"Magnetotunneling through a quantum well in a tilted field I: Periodic
  orbit theory","A semiclassical theory is developed and compared to experiments on the tunneling resonance spectrum for a quantum well in magnetic field tilted with respect to the tunneling direction. As the tilt angle is increased from zero the classical mechanics of an electron trapped within the well undergoes a smooth transition from integrable to chaotic dynamics. Perturbation theory is invalid for most of the regime of experimental interest, motivating a semiclassical treatment based on short periodic orbits within the well. In this paper we present a unified theory of all the periodic orbits within the well which are of relevance to experiments and show that they are all related to bifurcations of the period-one traversing orbits. An analytic theory is derived for the period and stability of these traversing orbits. An unusual feature of the classical mechanics of this system is the existence of certain important periodic orbits only in finite energy bands. We calculate the widths of these bands and relate them to experimental data. In the forthcoming paper the results for these short periodic orbits are used in conjunction with a novel semiclassical tunneling formula to calculate the magnetotunneling current, which is then compared with experiments.",cond
116,Correlated Photon-Pair Emission from a Charged Single Quantum Dot,"The optical creation and recombination of charged biexciton and trion complexes in an (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dot is investigated by micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. Photon cross-correlation measurements demonstrate the temporally correlated decay of charged biexciton and trion states. Our calculations provide strong evidence for radiative decay from the excited trion state which allows for a deeper insight into the spin configurations and their dynamics in these systems.",cond
117,Fluctuations of elastic interfaces in fluids: Theory and simulation,"We study the dynamics of elastic interfaces-membranes-immersed in thermally excited fluids. The work contains three components: the development of a numerical method, a purely theoretical approach, and numerical simulation. In developing a numerical method, we first discuss the dynamical coupling between the interface and the surrounding fluids. An argument is then presented that generalizes the single-relaxation time lattice-Boltzmann method for the simulation of hydrodynamic interfaces to include the elastic properties of the boundary. The implementation of the new method is outlined and it is tested by simulating the static behavior of spherical bubbles and the dynamics of bending waves. By means of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem we recover analytically the equilibrium frequency power spectrum of thermally fluctuating membranes and the correlation function of the excitations. Also, the non-equilibrium scaling properties of the membrane roughening are deduced, leading us to formulate a scaling law describing the interface growth, W^2(L,T)=L^3 g[t/L^(5/2)], where W, L and T are the width of the interface, the linear size of the system and the temperature respectively, and g is a scaling function. Finally, the phenomenology of thermally fluctuating membranes is simulated and the frequency power spectrum is recovered, confirming the decay of the correlation function of the fluctuations. As a further numerical study of fluctuating elastic interfaces, the non-equilibrium regime is reproduced by initializing the system as an interface immersed in thermally pre-excited fluids.",cond
118,"EM wave propagation in two-dimensional photonic crystals: a study of
  anomalous refractive effects","We systematically study a collection of refractive phenomena that can possibly occur at the interface of a two-dimensional photonic crystal, with the use of the wave vector diagram formalism. Cases with a single propagating beam (in the positive or the negative direction) as well as cases with birefringence were observed. We examine carefully the conditions to obtain a single propagating beam inside the photonic crystal lattice. Our results indicate, that the presence of multiple reflected beams in the medium of incidence is neither a prerequisite nor does it imply multiple refracted beams. We characterize our results in respect to the origin of the propagating beam and the nature of propagation (left-handed or not). We identified four distinct cases that lead to a negatively refracted beam. Under these findings, the definition of phase velocity in a periodic medium is revisited and its physical interpretation discussed. To determine the ``rightness'' of propagation, we propose a wedge-type experiment. We discuss the intricate details for an appropriate wedge design for different types of cases in triangular and square structures. We extend our theoretical analysis, and examine our conclusions as one moves from the limit of photonic crystals with high index contrast between the constituent dielectrics to photonic crystals with low modulation of the refractive index. Finally, we examine the ``rightness'' of propagation in the one-dimensional multilayer medium, and obtain conditions that are different from those of two-dimensional systems.",cond
119,"Breakdown of Migdal's theorem and intensity of electron-phonon coupling
  in high-Tc superconductors","In this article we quantify the possible effects of the breakdown of Migdal's theorem on the electron-phonon (e-p) coupling constant, on the critical temperature and on the superconducting gap by examining different kinds of superconducting materials either with low and high critical temperature. We use the theoretical approach developed by Grimaldi, Pietronero and Strassler [PRB 52, 10516 & 10530 (1995)] on experimental data taken both from literature and from our recent break-junction tunneling experiments in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x} (BSCCO) [Physica C 275, 162 (1997) and cond-mat/9612220]. The results show that a large violation of the Migdal's theorem (as in BSCCO) yields to a large increase of the observed e-p coupling constant and, in a first approximation and by direct solution of the Eliashberg equations, to large but different increases of Tc and gap. The same theory gives no modifications when applied to low-Tc conventional superconductors. In BSCCO, the renormalized values of the e-p coupling constant and of the ratio 2Delta/kTc (1.85 and 4.98, respectively) are compatible with a strong-coupling electron-phonon origin of superconductivity.",cond
120,"Evidence of Microscopic-Scale Modifications in Optical Glasses
  Supporting Second Harmonic Generation","We explore, by means of inelastic neutron scattering, the extent of changes in dynamic correlations induced by thermal poling of vitreous $SiO_2$. The measured vibrational density of states shows an excess of modes in certain frequency regions as well as a narrowing of the 100 meV peak. These findings indicate that such alterations cannot be ascribed to the appearance of new well defined vibrational modes, such as those coming from localized topological defects, but rather arises from an increase in ordering in the material as attested in a reduced spread of the inter-tetrahedral angles.",cond
121,Extreme deviations and applications,"Stretched exponential probability density functions (pdf), having the form of the exponential of minus a fractional power of the argument, are commonly found in turbulence and other areas. They can arise because of an underlying random multiplicative process. For this, a theory of extreme deviations is developed, devoted to the far tail of the pdf of the sum $X$ of a finite number $n$ of independent random variables with a common pdf $e^{-f(x)}$. The function $f(x)$ is chosen (i) such that the pdf is normalized and (ii) with a strong convexity condition that $f''(x)>0$ and that $x^2f''(x)\to +\infty$ for $|x|\to\infty$. Additional technical conditions ensure the control of the variations of $f''(x)$. The tail behavior of the sum comes then mostly from individual variables in the sum all close to $X/n$ and the tail of the pdf is $\sim e^{-nf(X/n)}$. This theory is then applied to products of independent random variables, such that their logarithms are in the above class, yielding usually stretched exponential tails. An application to fragmentation is developed and compared to data from fault gouges. The pdf by mass is obtained as a weighted superposition of stretched exponentials, reflecting the coexistence of different fragmentation generations. For sizes near and above the peak size, the pdf is approximately log-normal, while it is a power law for the smaller fragments, with an exponent which is a decreasing function of the peak fragment size. The anomalous relaxation of glasses can also be rationalized using our result together with a simple multiplicative model of local atom configurations. Finally, we indicate the possible relevance to the distribution of small-scale velocity increments in turbulent flow.",cond
122,"Nonequilibrium transport and population inversion in double quantum dot
  systems","We present a microscopic theory for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium transport properties of coupled double quantum dots (DQD). A general formula for current tunneling through the DQD is derived by the nonequilibrium Green's function method. Using a Hartree-Fock approach, effects of multi-level coupling and nonequilibrium electron distributions in resonant tunneling are considered. We find that the peak in the resonant tunneling current through two symmetric dots will split only when the inter-dot coupling is stronger than dot-lead coupling. We predict that population inversion can be achieved in one dot in the nonequilibrium regime.",cond
123,Superconductivity of a Metallic Stripe Embedded in an Antiferromagnet,"We study a simple model for the metallic stripes found in $La_{1.6-x}Nd_{0.4}Sr_xCuO_4$: two chain Hubbard ladder embedded in a static antiferromagnetic environments. We consider two cases: a ``topological stripe'', for which the phase of the Neel order parameter shifts by $\pi$ across the ladder, and a ``non-topological stripe'', for which there is no phase shift across the ladder. We perform one-loop renormalization group calculations to determine the low energy properties. We compare the results with those of the isolated ladder and show that for small doping superconductivity is enhanced in the topological stripe, and suppressed in the non-topological one. In the topological stripe, the superconducting order parameter is a mixture of a spin singlet component with zero momentum and a spin triplet component with momentum $\pi$. We argue that this mixture is generic, and is due to the presence of a new term in the quantum Ginzburg-Landau action. Some consequences of this mixing are discussed.",cond
124,"Entropic Origin of the Growth of Relaxation Times in Simple Glassy
  Liquids",Transitions between ``glassy'' local minima of a model free-energy functional for a dense hard-sphere system are studied numerically using a ``microcanonical'' Monte Carlo method that enables us to obtain the transition probability as a function of the free energy and the Monte Carlo ``time''. The growth of the height of the effective free energy barrier with density is found to be consistent with a Vogel-Fulcher law. The dependence of the transition probability on time indicates that this growth is primarily due to entropic effects arising from the difficulty of finding low-free-energy saddle points connecting glassy minima.,cond
125,"Shape oscillations in non-degenerate Bose gases - transition from the
  collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime","We investigate collective oscillations of non-degenerate clouds of Rb-87 atoms as a function of density in an elongated magnetic trap. For the low-lying M=0 monopole-quadrupole shape oscillation we measure the oscillation frequencies and damping rates. At the highest densities the mean-free-path is smaller than the axial dimension of the sample, which corresponds to collisionally hydrodynamic conditions. This allows us to cover the cross-over from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime. The experimental results show good agreement with theory. We also analyze the influence of trap anharmonicities on the oscillations in relation to observed temperature dependencies of the dipole and quadrupole oscillation frequencies. We present convenient expressions to quantify these effects.",cond
126,"Superconductivity Suppression Close to the Metal-Insulator Transition in
  Strongly Disordered Systems","On the basis of the recently proposed self-consistent theory of metal- insulator transition in strongly disordered systems, taking into account interaction effects, we study transition temperature $T_{c}$ suppression in disordered superconductors for the wide disorder interval --- from weakly disordered metal up to Anderson insulator, induced by ""Coulomb pseudogap"" formation in the density of states. It is shown that for a number of systems this theory provides rather satisfactory fit of experimental data.",cond
127,Surface Effects in the Unitary Fermi Gas,"We study the extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) density functional of the superfluid unitary Fermi gas. This functional includes a gradient term which is essential to describe accurately the surface effects of the system, in particular with a small number of atoms, where the Thomas-Fermi (local density) approximation fails. We find that our ETF functional gives density profiles which are in good agreement with recent Monte Carlo results and also with a more sophisticated superfluid density functional based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. In addition, by using extended hydrodynamics equations of superfluids, we calculate the frequencies of collective surface oscillations of the unitary Fermi gas, showing that quadrupole and octupole modes strongly depend on the number of trapped atoms.",cond
128,"Localization of spin mixing dynamics in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein
  condensate","We propose to localize spin mixing dynamics in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate by a temporal modulation of spin exchange interaction, which is tunable with optical Feshbach resonance. Adopting techniques from coherent control, we demonstrate the localization/freezing of spin mixing dynamics, and the suppression of the intrinsic dynamic instability and spontaneous spin domain formation in a ferromagnetically interacting condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. This work points to a promising scheme for investigating the weak magnetic spin dipole interaction, which is usually masked by the more dominant spin exchange interaction.",cond
129,Fluctuator in disordered metallic point contacts: a simulation approach,Electron transport through amorphous monatomic metallic structures generated earlier by molecular dynamics simulations is studied numerically. The interference of electronic trajectories backscattered by the structural disorder probes the multistable structural relaxations responsible for low-frequency noise in real metallic contacts. The structure of these modes is visualized; the dependence of noise magnitude on size and structure of the modes is studied. The transition from multistable behaviour to a more complex one is observed for temperatures far below the melting temperature. The current fluctuations observed numerically resemble the complex behaviour reported earlier for current noise in small metallic structures at moderate temperatures.,cond
130,Quantum Bose Josephson Junction with binary mixtures of BECs,"We study the quantum behaviour of a binary mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a double-well potential starting from a two-mode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We focus on the small tunneling amplitude regime and apply perturbation theory up to second order. Analytical expressions for the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates are obtained. Then the quantum evolution of the number difference of bosons between the two potential wells is fully investigated for two different initial conditions: completely localized states and coherent spin states. In the first case both the short and the long time dynamics is studied and a rich behaviour is found, ranging from small amplitude oscillations and collapses and revivals to coherent tunneling. In the second case the short-time scale evolution of number difference is determined and a more irregular dynamics is evidenced. Finally, the formation of Schroedinger cat states is considered and shown to affect the momentum distribution.",cond

We show that both models are equivalent to a 5-vertex model on the square lattice with interlayer vertex-vertex interactions. Using the method of Bethe ansatz, a closed-form expression for the free energy is obtained and analyzed. We deduce the exact phase diagram and determine the nature of the phase transitions as a function of the strength of the interlayer interaction.",cond
132,"First Order Metal-Insulator Transition in Two-dimensional Disordered
  Systems","In the absence of magnetic field or spin-orbit coupling the one-parameter scaling theory predicts localization of all states in two-dimensional (2D) disordered systems, for any amount of disorder. However, a 2D metallic phase has been recently reported in high mobility Si-MOS and GaAs-based materials without magnetic field. We study numerically a recently proposed 2D model which consists of a compactly coupled pure-random plane structure. This allows to obtain exactly a continuum of one-dimensional ballistic extended states which can lead to a marginal metallic phase of finite conductivity $\sigma_{0}=2e^2/h$, in a wide energy range whose boundaries define the mobility edges of a first-order metal-insulator transition. We present numerical diagonalization results and the conductivity of the system in perpendicular magnetic field, which verify the above analytical predictions. The model is also discussed in connection to recent experiments.",cond
133,Reaction-Diffusion-Branching Models of Stock Price Fluctuations,"Several models of stock trading [P. Bak et al, Physica A {\bf 246}, 430 (1997)] are analyzed in analogy with one-dimensional, two-species reaction-diffusion-branching processes. Using heuristic and scaling arguments, we show that the short-time market price variation is subdiffusive with a Hurst exponent $H=1/4$. Biased diffusion towards the market price and blind-eyed copying lead to crossovers to the empirically observed random-walk behavior ($H=1/2$) at long times. The calculated crossover forms and diffusion constants are shown to agree well with simulation data.",cond
134,"Quantitative test of mean-field description of a trapped two-dimensional
  Bose gas","We investigate the accuracy of two mean-field theories of the trapped two-dimensional Bose gas at predicting transition region properties by comparison to non-perturbative classical field calculations. To make these comparisons we examine the density profiles and the predictions for the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid transition temperature over a parameter range in which the degree of thermal activation in the tightly trapped direction varies considerably. These results present an important test of these mean-field theories, and provide a characterization of their typical accuracy.",cond
135,"Electron conduction within Landau level tails of medium-mobility GaAs /
  AlGaAs heterostructures","The temperature dependence of both components of the resistivity tensor $\varrho_{xx}(T)$ and $\varrho_{xy}(T)$ has been studied at T $\geq$ 4.2 K within IQHE plateaux around filling factors \nu=2 and \nu=4 of medium- -mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. In the middle of the mobility gap standard activated conductivity has been found with activation energies $\Delta $ scaling well with $\hbar\omega_{c} / 2$ . At filling factors slightly below $\nu$=2 another contribution adds to the activated conductivity at T $\leq$ 12 K. This additional contribution can be further enhanced at higher mesuring d.c. currents.We suggest, that it arises due to enhanced electric field assisted tunneling across potential barriers separating localized states within the bulk of the sample.This effect contributes to the backscattering across the sample leading to an enhanced longitudinal conductivity. The additional contribution to $\sigma_{xx}(T)$ can be reasonably well fitted to the formula for the variable range hopping in strong magnetic fields indicating that the hopping can persist even at temperatures well above 4.2K.",cond
136,"Kawasaki dynamics and equilibrium distributions in simulations of phase
  separating systems","We compare equilibrium probability distributions obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for different spin exchange dynamics with the exact Boltzmann distribution for the fixed magnetization Ising model on small lattices. We present simple arguments and numerical evidence in order to show that ""efficient"" Kawasaki exchange does not lead to Boltzmann equilibrium distributions and that nearest-neighbour equal spin-exchange must be considered. Arbitrary distance opposite spin interchange is indicated as an alternative to obtaining the full phase diagram with phase separation.",cond

138,"Local structure studies of the underdoped-overdoped transition in
  YBa_2Cu_3O_x. Measurement of the yttrium y-ray absorption fine structure","We have measured the extended x-ray absorption-fine-structure (EXAFS) at the Y-K edge of YBa_2Cu_3O_x for x=6.801, 6.947, 6.968, 6.984 at T=20-300 K. Across the underdoped-overdoped transition the Y-Cu2 pairs exhibit harmonic vibrations which freeze out in the superconducting phase, whereas the Y-O2,3 pairs exhibit strong anharmonicities with a singularity at T_c. In the underdoped regime the average spacing O2,3-Cu2 increases with x due to displacements of Cu2 towards Ba, but the average position of O2,3 along c is almost unaffected. Optimum doping is a notable point in the x-T phase diagram, also concerning the lattice degrees of freedom. Here the O2,3-Cu2 spacing (buckling) is largest, and in the superconducting phase the Cu2 position along the c-axis is independent on temperature. In the overdoped regime increasing x displaces the Cu2 along c further towards Ba, but the O2,3 layer starts to shift in the same direction, thus decreasing the O2,3-Cu2 spacing.",cond

The transition is induced by an external magnetic field applied along the c-axis of the tetragonal structure, i. e., in the plane of spin rotation. Bulk magnetic measurements and neutron diffraction experiments show that the transition occurs in a critical field Hc=2.1T. Experimental results for the period of the magnetic structure and magnetization as functions of magnetic field are in quantitative agreement with our exact analytical solution for Dzyaloshinskii's model of commensurate-incommensurate transitions in spiral magnets.",cond
140,Theory of directed localization in one dimension,"We present an analytical solution of the delocalization transition that is induced by an imaginary vector potential in a disordered chain [N. Hatano and D. R. Nelson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 570 (1996), cond-mat/9603165]. We compute the relation between the real and imaginary parts of the energy in the thermodynamic limit, as well as finite-size effects. The results are in good agreement with numerical simulations for weak disorder (mean free path large compared to the wavelength).",cond
141,Finite size effects as the explanation of ``freezing'' in vortex liquids,"We investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the (mean-field) Abrikosov phase. The lower critical dimension of the superconducting phase is three, indicating the absence of the Abrikosov phase for dimensions d<3. Within the d=3 vortex liquid, the phase correlation length along the magnetic field direction grows exponentially rapidly as the temperature is lowered. For a finite bulk system, there is a 3D-2D crossover effect when the phase correlation length becomes comparable to the sample thickness. Such a crossover effect takes place over a very narrow temperature interval and mimics the ``first order transition'' seen in experiments on clean YBCO and BSCCO crystals. We calculate the jumps in the entropy, magnetization and specific heat due to the crossover and find reasonably good agreement with experiments on both YBCO and BSCCO.",cond

143,A Critique of Two Metals,"I argue that the conflict between the fermi-liquid and non-fermi-liquid metallic states viewed by Anderson as the central intellectual issue of cuprate superconductivity, and which motivates the recent criticism by Baskaran and Anderson [cond-mat/9706076] of the work of Zhang [cond-mat/9610140], is a fundamentally wrong concept. All experimental evidence points to adiabatic continuability of the strange metal into a conventional one, and thus to one metallic phase rather than two, and all attempts to account theoretically for the existence of a luttinger-liquid at zero temperature in spatial dimension greater than 1 have failed. I discuss the underlying reasons for this failure and then argue that the true higher-dimensional generalization of the luttinger-liquid behavior is a propensity of the system to order. I speculate about how the conflict between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity, the two principal kinds of order in this problem, might result in both the observed zero-temperature phase diagram of the cuprates and the luttinger-liquid phenomenology, i.e. the breakup of the electron into spinons and holons in certain regimes of doping and energy. The key idea is a quantum critical point regulating a first-order transition between these phases and toward which one is first attracted under renormalization before bifurcating between the two phases.",cond
144,"Lattice Distortions Around a Tl+ Impurity in NaI:Tl+ and CsI:Tl+
  Scintillators. An Ab Initio Study Involving Large Active Clusters",Ab initio Perturbed Ion cluster-in-the-lattice calculations of the impurity centers NaI:Tl+ and CsI:Tl+ are pressented. We study several active clusters of increasing complexity and show that the lattice relaxation around the Tl+ impurity implies the concerted movement of several shells of neighbors. The results also reveal the importance of considering a set of ions that can respond to the geometrical displacements of the inner shells by adapting selfconsistently their wave functions. Comparison with other calculations involving comparatively small active clusters serves to assert the significance of our conclusions. Contact with experiment is made by calculating absorption energies. These are in excellent agreement with the experimental data for the most realistic active clusters considered.,cond
145,Heat Capacity of a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas,"We report on the measurement of the heat capacity for an optically-trapped, strongly-interacting Fermi gas of atoms. In the experiments, a precise input of energy to the gas is followed by single-parameter thermometry. The thermometry determines a temperature parameter $\tilde{T}$ from the best fit of a Thomas-Fermi distribution with a fixed Fermi radius to the spatial density of the cloud. At $\tilde{T}=0.33$, we observe a transition between two patterns of behavior: For $\tilde{T}=0.33-2.15$, we find that the heat capacity closely corresponds to that of a trapped normal Fermi gas of atoms with increased mass. At low temperatures $\tilde{T}=0.04-0.33$, the heat capacity clearly deviates from normal Fermi gas behavior.",cond
146,Optical properties of photonic crystal slabs with asymmetrical unit cell,"Using the unitarity and reciprocity properties of the scattering matrix, we analyse the symmetry and resonant optical properties of the photonic crystal slabs (PCS) with complicated unit cell. We show that the reflectivity is not changed upon the 180deg-rotation of the sample around the normal axis, even in PCS with asymmetrical unit cell. Whereas the transmissivity becomes asymmetrical if the diffraction or absorption are present. The PCS reflectivity peaks to unity near the quasiguided mode resonance for normal light incidence in the absence of diffraction, depolarisation, and absorptive losses. For the oblique incidence the full reflectivity is reached only in symmetrical PCS.",cond
147,Surface relaxation and ferromagnetism of Rh(001),"The significant discrepancy between first-principles calculations and experimental analyses for the relaxation of the (001) surface of rhodium has been a puzzle for some years. In this paper we present density functional theory calculations using the local-density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation of the exchange-correlation functional. We investigate the thermal expansion of the surface and the possibility of surface magnetism. The results throw light on several, hitherto overlooked, aspects of metal surfaces. We find, that, when the free energy is considered, density-functional theory provides results in good agreement with experiments.",cond

If a defect is introduced in the photonic quantum well structures, defect modes with a very high quality factor may appear. The transmission of the defect mode is due to the coupling between the eigenmodes of the defect and those at the band edges of the constituent photonic crystals.",cond

Especially we discuss the competitions between the BF degenerate states and the Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in low-T. The criterion for the BEC realization is obtained from the algebraically-derived phase diagrams at T=0.,cond
150,"Stationary Localized States Due to a Nonlinear Dimeric Impurity Embedded
  in a Perfect 1-D Chain","The formation of Stationary Localized states due to a nonlinear dimeric impurity embedded in a perfect 1-d chain is studied here using the appropriate Discrete Nonlinear Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger Equation. Furthermore, the nonlinearity has the form, $\chi |C|^\sigma$ where $C$ is the complex amplitude. A proper ansatz for the Localized state is introduced in the appropriate Hamiltonian of the system to obtain the reduced effective Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian contains a parameter, $\beta = \phi_1/\phi_0$ which is the ratio of stationary amplitudes at impurity sites. Relevant equations for Localized states are obtained from the fixed point of the reduced dynamical system. $|\beta|$ = 1 is always a permissible solution. We also find solutions for which $|\beta| \ne 1$. Complete phase diagram in the $(\chi, \sigma)$ plane comprising of both cases is discussed. Several critical lines separating various regions are found. Maximum number of Localized states is found to be six. Furthermore, the phase diagram continuously extrapolates from one region to the other. The importance of our results in relation to solitonic solutions in a fully nonlinear system is discussed.",cond
151,"Anomalous temperature dependence of surface tension and capillary waves
  at liquid gallium",The temperature dependence of surface tension \gamma(T) at liquid gallium is studied theoretically and experimentally using light scattering from capillary waves. The theoretical model based on the Gibbs thermodynamics relates the temperature derivative of \gamma to the surface excess entropy -\Delta S. Although capillary waves contribute to the surface entropy with a positive sign the effect of dipole layer on \Delta S is negative. Experimental data collected at a free Ga surface in the temperature range from 30 to 160 C show that the temperature derivative of the tension changes sign near 100 C.,cond
152,Random Dirac Fermions and Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics,We study the influence of a strong imaginary vector potential on the quantum mechanics of particles confined to a two-dimensional plane and propagating in a random impurity potential. We show that the wavefunctions of the non-Hermitian operator can be obtained as the solution to a two-dimensional Dirac equation in the presence of a random gauge field. Consequences for the localization properties and the critical nature of the states are discussed.,cond

This provides a tool to engineer strongly correlated phases with reduced decoherence from inelastic collisions and spontaneous emission. As an illustration, we discuss the quantum phases of dressed atoms with dipole-dipole interactions confined in a harmonic potential, as relevant to experiments. We show that residual spontaneous emission from the Rydberg state acts as a heating mechanism, leading to a quantum-classical crossover.",cond
154,Phase separation and crystallisation of polydisperse hard spheres,Hard spheres with a polydispersity above approximately 8% are shown to crystallise into two phase-separated solid phases. A polydispersity above 8% is too large to be tolerated by a single solid phase but phase separation produces two fractions with polydispersities sufficiently narrow to allow them to crystallise. It may not be possible to observe this in experiment due to the intervention of a glass transition.,cond
155,A Study of Activated Processes in Soft Sphere Glass,"On the basis of long simulations of a binary mixture of soft spheres just below the glass transition, we make an exploratory study of the activated processes that contribute to the dynamics.

156,Polymer Winding Numbers and Quantum Mechanics,"The winding of a single polymer in thermal equilibrium around a repulsive cylindrical obstacle is perhaps the simplest example of statistical mechanics in a multiply connected geometry. As shown by S.F. Edwards, this problem is closely related to the quantum mechanics of a charged particle interacting with a Aharonov-Bohm flux. In another development, Pollock and Ceperley have shown that boson world lines in 2+1 dimensions with periodic boundary conditions, regarded as ring polymers on a torus, have a mean square winding number given by $<W^2> = 2n_s\hbar^2/mk_BT$, where $m$ is the boson mass and $n_s$ is the superfluid number density. Here, we review the mapping of the statistical mechanics of polymers with constraints onto quantum mechanics, and show that there is an interesting generalization of the Pollock-Ceperley result to directed polymer melts interacting with a repulsive rod of radius $a$. When translated into boson language, the mean square winding number around the rod for a system of size $R$ perpendicular to the rod reads $<W^2> = {n_s\hbar^2\over 2\pi mk_BT}\ln(R/a)$. This result is directly applicable to vortices in Type II superconductors in the presence of columnar defects. An external current passing through the rod couples directly to the winding number in this case.",cond
157,Perturbative studies of the conductivity in the vortex-liquid regime,"We calculate the Aslamazov-Larkin term of the conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field applied along the c-axis from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation perturbatively using two approaches. In the first a uniform electric field is explicitly applied; in the second the Kubo formula is used to extract the linear response. The former yields a version of the flux-flow formula for the uniform ab-plane conductivity, sigma_{xx}(k=0), that holds to all orders of perturbation theory. Obtaining the same result from the Kubo formula requires considerable cancellation of terms. We also use the Kubo calculation to examine the nonlocal ab-plane conductivity, sigma_{xx}( k \neq 0) (where the cancellations no longer occur), as well as the nonlocal c-axis conductivity sigma_{zz}( k \neq 0), and look for the perturbative precursors of the growing viscous length scales. In addition, we consider the effects of weak disorder -- both uncorrelated (point defects) and correlated (columnar and planar defects).",cond

Our results are in full agreement with experimental findings.",cond
160,"Self-organized criticality in the hysteresis of the Sherrington -
  Kirkpatrick model","We study hysteretic phenomena in random ferromagnets. We argue that the angle dependent magnetostatic (dipolar) terms introduce frustration and long range interactions in these systems. This makes it plausible that the Sherrington - Kirkpatrick model may be able to capture some of the relevant physics of these systems. We use scaling arguments, replica calculations and large scale numerical simulations to characterize the hysteresis of the zero temperature SK model. By constructing the distribution functions of the avalanche sizes, magnetization jumps and local fields, we conclude that the system exhibits self-organized criticality everywhere on the hysteresis loop.",cond

We work out the exact phase diagrams for various values of $J_{nnn}/J_{nn}$ and compare these with the case of pure nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings. We also give some similar results for the 1D Potts model with NN and NNN couplings.",cond

Lett. 100 200408), and assuming the particles are described by the Haldane-Wu fractional exclusion statistics (FES) at unitarity. This approach is applied to atoms trapped into a three dimensional harmonic oscillator. We show that the parameter-free FES semiclassical theory yields results that are consistent with numerical simulations by Chang and Bertsch [2007 Phys. Rev A 76 021603(R)] and Bulgac (2007 Phys. Rev.

Our results indicate that spin excitations in the superconducting state are essentially the same as those in the fully doped material except that the unusual 41 meV resonance is observed at 34.8 meV. The normal state spin excitations are characterized by a weakly energy-dependent continuum whose temperature dependence shows the clear signature of a superconducting gap at Tc. The enhancement at the resonance is accompanied by a suppression of magnetic fluctuations at both higher and lower energies.,cond
164,Aging and diffusion in low dimensional environments,"We study out of equilibrium dynamics and aging for a particle diffusing in one dimensional environments, such as the random force Sinai model, as a toy model for low dimensional systems. We study fluctuations of two times $(t_w, t)$ quantities from the probability distribution $Q(z,t,t_w)$ of the relative displacement $z = x(t) - x(t_w)$ in the limit of large waiting time $t_w \to \infty$ using numerical and analytical techniques. We find three generic large time regimes: (i) a quasi-equilibrium regime (finite $\tau=t-t_w$) where $Q(z,\tau)$ satisfies a general FDT equation (ii) an asymptotic diffusion regime for large time separation where $Q(z) dz \sim \bar{Q}[L(t)/L(t_w)] dz/L(t)$ (iii) an intermediate ``aging'' regime for intermediate time separation ($h(t)/h(t_w)$ finite), with $Q(z,t,t') = f(z,h(t)/h(t')) $. In the unbiased Sinai model we find numerical evidence for regime (i) and (ii), and for (iii) with $\bar{Q(z,t,t')} = Q_0(z) f(h(t)/h(t'))$ and $h(t) \sim \ln t$. Since $h(t) \sim L(t)$ in Sinai's model there is a singularity in the diffusion regime to allow for regime (iii). A directed model, related to the biased Sinai model is solved and shows (ii) and (iii) with strong non self-averaging properties. Similarities and differences with mean field results are discussed. A general approach using scaling of next highest encountered barriers is proposed to predict aging properties, $h(t)$ and $f(x)$ in landscapes with fast growing barriers. We introduce a new exactly solvable model, with barriers and wells, which shows clearly diffusion and aging regimes with a rich variety of functions $h(t)$.",cond

  of the Coulomb matrix","We present parallelization of a quantum-chemical tree-code [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 106}, 5526 (1997)] for linear scaling computation of the Coulomb matrix. Equal time partition [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 118}, 9128 (2003)] is used to load balance computation of the Coulomb matrix. Equal time partition is a measurement based algorithm for domain decomposition that exploits small variation of the density between self-consistent-field cycles to achieve load balance. Efficiency of the equal time partition is illustrated by several tests involving both finite and periodic systems. It is found that equal time partition is able to deliver 91 -- 98 % efficiency with 128 processors in the most time consuming part of the Coulomb matrix calculation. The current parallel quantum chemical tree code is able to deliver 63 -- 81% overall efficiency on 128 processors with fine grained parallelism (less than two heavy atoms per processor).",cond

In its simplest form this approach utilizes for attractive condensates the Gross-Pitaevskii symmetry-broken solution and arrives at a ground-state of correct symmetry. Furthermore, the energy found is {\it lower} than the Gross-Pitaevskii one and, with increasing number of particles and/or strength of inter-particle interaction, is even {\it lower} than that accessed by tractable diagonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian. Implications also to excited states are briefly discussed.",cond

  geometrical role of weight","In order to take the weight of connection into consideration and to find a natural measurement of weight, we have collected papers in Econophysics and constructed a network of scientific communication to integrate idea transportation among econophysicists by collaboration, citation and personal discussion. Some basic statistics such as weight per degree are discussed in \cite{fan}. In this paper, by including the papers published recently, further statistical results for the network are reported. Clustering coefficient of weighted network is introduced and empirically studied in this network. We also compare the typical statistics on this network under different weight measurements, including random and inverse weight. The conclusion from weight-randomized network is helpful to the investigation of the geometrical role of weight.",cond
168,Dielectric resonances of binary random networks,"We investigate the AC conductivity of binary random impedance networks, with emphasis on its dependence on the ratio of the complex conductances of both phases. We propose an algorithm to determine the conductance of a finite network, in terms of its poles and of the associated residues. A numerical implementation of the algorithm, on the example of the square lattice, allows a detailed investigation of the resonant dielectric response of the binary model, including the density of resonances, the spectral function, the distribution of spacings between resonances. The distribution of local electric fields at resonance is found to be multifractal.",cond
169,Field Theory of Branching and Annihilating Random Walks,"We develop a systematic analytic approach to the problem of branching and annihilating random walks, equivalent to the diffusion-limited reaction processes 2A->0 and A->(m+1)A, where m>=1. Starting from the master equation, a field-theoretic representation of the problem is derived, and fluctuation effects are taken into account via diagrammatic and renormalization group methods. For d>2, the mean-field rate equation, which predicts an active phase as soon as the branching process is switched on, applies qualitatively for both even and odd m, but the behavior in lower dimensions is shown to be quite different for these two cases. For even m, and d~2, the active phase still appears immediately, but with non-trivial crossover exponents which we compute in an expansion in eps=2-d, and with logarithmic corrections in d=2. However, there exists a second critical dimension d_c'~4/3 below which a non-trivial inactive phase emerges, with asymptotic behavior characteristic of the pure annihilation process. This is confirmed by an exact calculation in d=1. The subsequent transition to the active phase, which represents a new non-trivial dynamic universality class, is then investigated within a truncated loop expansion. For odd m, we show that the fluctuations of the annihilation process are strong enough to create a non-trivial inactive phase for all d<=2. In this case, the transition to the active phase is in the directed percolation universality class.",cond
170,Mode-Locking in Quantum-Hall-Effect Point Contacts,"We study the effect of an ac drive on the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a tunnel junction between two fractional Quantum Hall fluids at filling $\nu ^{-1}$ an odd integer. Within the chiral Luttinger liquid model of edge states, the point contact dynamics is described by a driven damped quantum mechanical pendulum. In a semi-classical limit which ignores electron tunnelling, this model exhibits mode-locking, which corresponds to current plateaus in the I-V curve at integer multiples of $I= e\omega /2\pi$, with $\omega$ the ac drive angular frequency. By analyzing the full quantum model at non-zero $\nu$ using perturbative and exact methods, we study the effect of quantum fluctuation on the mode-locked plateaus. For $\nu=1$ quantum fluctuations smear completely the plateaus, leaving no trace of the ac drive. For $\nu \ge 1/2$ smeared plateaus remain in the I-V curve, but are not centered at the currents $I=n e \omega /2\pi$. For $\nu < 1/2$ rounded plateaus centered around the quantized current values are found. The possibility of using mode locking in FQHE point contacts as a current-to-frequency standard is discussed.",cond
171,"General framework for a portfolio theory with non-Gaussian risks and
  non-linear correlations","Using a family of modified Weibull distributions, encompassing both sub-exponentials and super-exponentials, to parameterize the marginal distributions of asset returns and their natural multivariate generalizations, we give exact formulas for the tails and for the moments and cumulants of the distribution of returns of a portfolio make of arbitrary compositions of these assets. Using combinatorial and hypergeometric functions, we are in particular able to extend previous results to the case where the exponents of the Weibull distributions are different from asset to asset and in the presence of dependence between assets. We treat in details the problem of risk minimization using two different measures of risks (cumulants and value-at-risk) for a portfolio made of two assets and compare the theoretical predictions with direct empirical data. While good agreement is found, the remaining discrepancy between theory and data stems from the deviations from the Weibull parameterization for small returns. Our extended formulas enable us to determine analytically the conditions under which it is possible to ``have your cake and eat it too'', i.e., to construct a portfolio with both larger return and smaller ``large risks''.",cond

173,Superconducting gap node spectroscopy using nonlinear electrodynamics,"We present a method to determine the nodal structure of the energy gap of unconventional superconductors such as high $T_c$ materials. We show how nonlinear electrodynamics phenomena in the Meissner regime, arising from the presence of lines on the Fermi surface where the superconducting energy gap is very small or zero, can be used to perform ``node spectroscopy'', that is, as a sensitive bulk probe to locate the angular position of those lines. In calculating the nonlinear supercurrent response, we include the effects of orthorhombic distortion and $a-b$ plane anisotropy. Analytic results presented demonstrate a systematic way to experimentally distinguish order parameters of different symmetries, including cases with mixed symmetry (for example, $d+s$ and $s+id$). We consider, as suggested by various experiments, order parameters with predominantly $d$-wave character, and describe how to determine the possible presence of other symmetries. The nonlinear magnetic moment displays a distinct behavior if nodes in the gap are absent but regions with small, finite, values of the energy gap exist.",cond
174,Heating rates for an atom in a far-detuned optical lattice,"We calculate single atom heating rates in a far detuned optical lattice, in connection with recent experiments. We first derive a master equation, including a realistic atomic internal structure and a quantum treatment of the atomic motion in the lattice. The experimental feature that optical lattices are obtained by superimposing laser standing waves of different frequencies is also included, which leads to a micromotional correction to the light shift that we evaluate. We then calculate, and compare to experimental results, two heating rates, the ""total"" heating rate (corresponding to the increase of the total mechanical energy of the atom in the lattice), and the ground bande heating rate (corresponding to the increase of energy within the ground energy band of the lattice).",cond
175,"On the Functional Integral Theory of Systems with Kinematical

In X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments, we investigated the ordered structure, the one-dimensional (1D) and the three-dimensional (3D) critical scattering in the paraelectric phase, and the temperature dependence of the lattice constants. Our results can be explained by microscopic models of the methanol pseudospin in the hydroquinone cage network, in consistency with previous dielectric investigations.",cond
177,THE SHELL MAP: The structure of froths through a dynamical map,"The shell map is a very simple representation of the structure of foams, combining the geometrical (random tiling) and dynamical (loss of information from an arbitrary cell out) aspects of disorder. The structure is built from the central cell outward like an ever expanding jigsaw puzzle without boundary. The radial map, from one spherical layer of cells to the next, is the logistic map, and the geometrical tiling is expressed mathematically as a dynamical system. The isotropy of the disordered structure is expressed locally by averaging over each layer. The over-all translational invariance is manifest in the independence of the structure and properties on the choice of the central cell. The radial map from one layer to the next includes both effects of disorder and of space curvature. We will illustrate it and give several examples, including a few arising from discussions in Cargese.",cond
178,Flux noise in high-temperature superconductors,"Spontaneously created vortex-antivortex pairs are the predominant source of flux noise in high-temperature superconductors. In principle, flux noise measurements allow to check theoretical predictions for both the distribution of vortex-pair sizes and for the vortex diffusivity. In this paper the flux-noise power spectrum is calculated for the highly anisotropic high-temperature superconductor Bi-2212, both for bulk crystals and for ultra-thin films. The spectrum is basically given by the Fourier transform of the temporal magnetic-field correlation function. We start from a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type theory and incorporate vortex diffusion, intra-pair vortex interaction, and annihilation of pairs by means of a Fokker-Planck equation to determine the noise spectrum below and above the superconducting transition temperature. We find white noise at low frequencies omega and a spectrum proportional to 1/omega^(3/2) at high frequencies. The cross-over frequency between these regimes strongly depends on temperature. The results are compared with earlier results of computer simulations.",cond
179,A new uncertainty Relation (revised version),"We formulate according to the quantum mechanical uncertainty relation a new quantum electrodynamical uncertainty relation $\Delta \breve{A} . \Delta l \sim \hbar/e$ where $\breve{A}$ and $\Delta l \geq l_B$ are the electromagnetic pure gauge potential, the position uncertainty and the magnetic length, respectively. Then, we show that the observed potential drops on the edge of QHE samples are varifications of this uncertainty relation, where the quantum potential drop of the relevant component of potential can be considered as its quantum uncertainty $\Delta \breve{A}$.",cond
180,A Model of Interface Growth with non-Burgers Dynamical Exponent,"We define a new model of interface roughening which has the property that the minimum of interface height is conserved locally during the growth. This model corresponds to the limit $q \to \infty$ of the q-color dimer deposition-evaporation model introduced by us earlier [Hari Menon M K and Dhar D 1995 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 28 6517]. We present numerical evidence from Monte Carlo simulations and the exact diagonalization of the evolution operator on finite rings that this model is not in the universality class of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interface growth model. The dynamical exponent z in one dimension is larger than 2, with $z \approx 2.5$. And there are logarithmic corrections to the scaling of the gap with system size. Higher dimensional generalization of the model is briefly discussed.",cond
181,"Superfluid Bosons and Flux Liquids: Disorder, Thermal Fluctuations, and
  Finite-Size Effects","The influence of different types of disorder (both uncorrelated and correlated) on the superfluid properties of a weakly interacting or dilute Bose gas, as well as on the corresponding quantities for flux line liquids in high-temperature superconductors at low magnetic fields are reviewed, investigated and compared. We exploit the formal analogy between superfluid bosons and the statistical mechanics of directed lines, and explore the influence of the different ""imaginary time"" boundary conditions appropriate for a flux line liquid. For superfluids, we discuss the density and momentum correlations, the condensate fraction, and the normal-fluid density as function of temperature for two- and three-dimensional systems subject to a space- and time-dependent random potential as well as conventional point-, line-, and plane-like defects. In the case of vortex liquids subject to point disorder, twin boundaries, screw dislocations, and various configurations of columnar damage tracks, we calculate the corresponding quantities, namely density and tilt correlations, the ``boson'' order parameter, and the tilt modulus. The finite-size corrections due to periodic vs. open ""imaginary time"" boundary conditions differ in interesting and important ways. Experimental implications for vortex lines are described briefly.",cond

The piezoelectric constants are found to be up 10 times larger than in conventional III-V's and II-VI's, and comparable to those of ZnO. Further properties at variance with those of conventional III-V compounds are the sign of the piezoelectric constants (positive as in II-VI's) and the very large spontaneous polarization.",cond
183,"Investigating liquid surfaces down to the nanometer scale using grazing
  incidence x-ray scattering","Grazing incidence x-ray surface scattering has been used to investigate liquid surfaces down to the molecular scale. The free surface of water is well described by the capillary wave model (<z(q)z(-q)> ~ q-2 spectrum) up to wavevectors > 10^8 m^-1. At larger wavevectors near-surface acoustic waves must be taken into account. When the interface is bounded by a surfactant monolayer, it exhibits a bending stiffness and the bending rigidity modulus can be measured. However, bending effects generally cannot be described using the Helfrich Hamiltonian and the characteristic exponent in the roughness power spectrum can smaller than 4. Finally, upon compression, tethered monolayers formed on a subphase containing divalent ions are shown to buckle in the third dimension with a characteristic wavelength on the order of 10^8 m^-1.",cond
184,Self-consistent Single-band Approximation for Interacting Boson Systems,"Traditionally, the single-band approximation for interacting many-body systems is done with pre-determined single-particle Wannier functions, ignoring the dependence of the Wannier function on interaction. We show that the single-band approximation has to be done self-consistently to properly account the interaction effect on the Wannier functions. This self-consistent single-band approximation leads to a nonlinear equation for Wannier functions, which can be recast into a set of nonlinear equations for Bloch functions. These equations are simplified for two special cases, the superfluid regime and deep in the Mott insulator regime. A simple example with double-well potential is used to illustrate our results.",cond
185,"Stripes, Pseudogaps, and Van Hove Nesting in the Three-band tJ Model","Slave boson calculations have been carried out in the three-band tJ model for the high-T_c cuprates, with the inclusion of coupling to oxygen breathing mode phonons. Phonon-induced Van Hove nesting leads to a phase separation between a hole-doped domain and a (magnetic) domain near half filling, with long-range Coulomb forces limiting the separation to a nanoscopic scale. Strong correlation effects pin the Fermi level close to, but not precisely at the Van Hove singularity (VHS), which can enhance the tendency to phase separation. The resulting dispersions have been calculated, both in the uniform phases and in the phase separated regime. In the latter case, distinctly different dispersions are found for large, random domains and for regular (static) striped arrays, and a hypothetical form is presented for dynamic striped arrays. The doping dependence of the latter is found to provide an excellent description of photoemission and thermodynamic experiments on pseudogap formation in underdoped cuprates. In particular, the multiplicity of observed gaps is explained as a combination of flux phase plus charge density wave (CDW) gaps along with a superconducting gap. The largest gap is associated with VHS nesting. The apparent smooth evolution of this gap with doping masks a crossover from CDW-like effects near optimal doping to magnetic effects (flux phase) near half filling. A crossover from large Fermi surface to hole pockets with increased underdoping is found. In the weakly overdoped regime, the CDW undergoes a quantum phase transition ($T_{CDW}\to 0$), which could be obscured by phase separation.",cond
186,"Mesoscopic quantum circuit theory to the persistent current and Coulomb
  blockade","The quantum theory for mesoscopic electric circuit is briefly described. The uncertainty relation for electric charge and current modifies the tranditional Heisenberg uncertainty relation. The mesoscopic ring is regarded as a pure L-design, and the persistent current is obtained explicitly. The Coulomb blockade phenomenon appears when applying to the pure C-design.",cond
187,"Hole Doping Evolution of the Quasiparticle Band in Models of Strongly
  Correlated Electrons for the High-T_c Cuprates","Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and Maximum Entropy (ME) techniques are used to study the spectral function $A({\bf p},\omega)$ of the one band Hubbard model in strong coupling including a next-nearest-neighbor electronic hopping with amplitude $t'/t= -0.35$. These values of parameters are chosen to improve the comparison of the Hubbard model with angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) data for $Sr_2 Cu O_2 Cl_2$. A narrow quasiparticle (q.p.) band is observed in the QMC analysis at the temperature of the simulation $T=t/3$, both at and away from half-filling. Such a narrow band produces a large accumulation of weight in the density of states at the top of the valence band. As the electronic density $< n >$ decreases further away from half-filling, the chemical potential travels through this energy window with a large number of states, and by $< n > \sim 0.70$ it has crossed it entirely. The region near momentum $(0,\pi)$ and $(\pi,0)$ in the spectral function is more sensitive to doping than momenta along the diagonal from $(0,0)$ to $(\pi,\pi)$. The evolution with hole density of the quasiparticle dispersion contains some of the features observed in recent ARPES data in the underdoped regime. For sufficiently large hole densities the ``flat'' bands at $(\pi,0)$ cross the Fermi energy, a prediction that could be tested with ARPES techniques applied to overdoped cuprates. The population of the q.p. band introduces a {\it hidden} density in the system which produces interesting consequences when the quasiparticles are assumed to interact through antiferromagnetic fluctuations and studied with the BCS gap equation formalism. In particular, a region of extended s-wave is found to compete with d-wave in the overdoped regime, i.e. when the chemical potential has almost entirely crossed the q.p.",cond
188,"The ordered and orientationally disordered crystalline phases of the
  flexible C4F8 molecule","There is ample experimental evidence on the existence of several crystalline phases of C4F8, although they still have been not clearly identified. In this paper we perform a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a partially flexible molecular model, which takes into account the mixing of the low frequency intramolecular modes and lattice modes. The calculations are carried on in the constant pressure- constant temperature ensemble and the algorithm employed allows volume and symmetry changes of the MD sample as a function of thermodynamic variables. Although several stable crystalline phases are found, their number is still less than found by experiments.",cond
189,Scale Invariance in Percolation Theory and Fractals,"The properties of the similarity transformation in percolation theory in the complex plane of the percolation probability are studied. It is shown that the percolation problem on a two-dimensional square lattice reduces to the Mandelbrot transformation, leading to a fractal behavior of the percolation probability in the complex plane. The hierarchical chains of impedances, reducing to a nonlinear mapping of the impedance space onto itself, are studied. An infinite continuation of the procedure leads to a fixed point. It is shown that the number of steps required to reach a neighborhood of this point has a fractal distribution.",cond
190,"Classical transverse Ising spin glass with short- range interaction
  beyond the mean field approximation","The classical transverse field Ising spin- glass model with short-range interactions is investigated beyond the mean- field approximation for a real d- dimensional lattice. We use an appropriate nontrivial modification of the Bethe- Peierls method recently formulated for the Ising spin- glass. The zero- temperature critical value of the transverse field and the linear susceptibility in the paramagnetic phase are obtained analytically as functions of dimensionality d. The phase diagram is also calculated numerically for different values of d. In the limit d -> infinity, known mean- field results are consistently reproduced.",cond
191,Diffusional Relaxation in Random Sequential Deposition,The effect of diffusional relaxation on the random sequential deposition process is studied in the limit of fast deposition. Expression for the coverage as a function of time are analytically derived for both the short-time and long-time regimes. These results are tested and compared with numerical simulations.,cond
192,Random copolymer: Gaussian variational approach,"We study the phase transitions of a random copolymer chain with quenched disorder. We apply a replica variational approach based on a Gaussian trial Hamiltonian in terms of the correlation functions of monomer Fourier coordinates. This allows us to study collapse, phase separation and freezing transitions within the same mean field theory. The effective free energy of the system is derived analytically and analysed numerically. Such quantities as the radius of gyration or the average value of the overlap between different replicas are treated as observables and evaluated by introducing appropriate external fields to the Hamiltonian. We obtain the phase diagram and show that this system exhibits a scale dependent freezing transition. The correlations between replicas appear at different length scales as the temperature decreases. This indicates the existence of the topological frustration.",cond
193,"Quadratic-nonlinear Landau-Zener transition for association of an atomic
  Bose-Einstein condensate with inter-particle elastic interactions included","We study the strong coupling limit of a quadratic-nonlinear Landau-Zener problem for coherent photo- and magneto-association of cold atoms taking into account the atom-atom, atom-molecule, and molecule-molecule elastic scattering. Using an exact third-order nonlinear differential equation for the molecular state probability, we develop a variational approach which enables us to construct a highly accurate and simple analytic approximation describing the time dynamics of the coupled atom-molecule system. We show that the approximation describing time evolution of the molecular state probability can be written as a sum of two distinct terms; the first one, being a solution to a limit first-order nonlinear equation, effectively describes the process of the molecule formation while the second one, being a scaled solution to the linear Landau-Zener problem (but now with negative effective Landau-Zener parameter as long as the strong coupling regime is considered), corresponds to the remaining oscillations which come up when the process of molecule formation is over.",cond
194,"Macroscopic self trapping in BECs: analysis of a dynamical quantum phase
  transition","We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential undergoing a dynamical transition from the regime of Josephson oscillations to the regime of self-trapping. We analyze the statistical properties of the ground state (or the highest excited state) of the Hamiltonian in these two regimes for attractive (repulsive) interactions. We demonstrate that it is impossible to describe the transition within the mean-field theory. In contrast, the transition proceeds through a strongly correlated delocalized state, with large quantum fluctuations, and spontaneous breaking of the symmetry.",cond
195,Spreading of Damage in the SK Spherical Spin Glass,By considering the Langevin dynamics of the SK spin glass with a spherical constraint we calculate the asymptotic distance between two real replicas that evolve with the same thermal noise from different initial conditions. Despite the simplicity of the model its dynamics is known to be non trivial and presents aging phenomena. We find that the asymptotic distance between two replicas is maximal for a whole family of initial conditions that are arbitrarily close at t=0 . The asymptotic distance presents a dynamical transition at a temperature equal to the static phase transition one.,cond
196,Induced supersolidity in a normal and hardcore boson mixture,"It is well known that the supersolid form of matter can arise in a single species of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice due to long range interactions. We present a scenario where a supersolid is induced in one of the components of a mixture of two species bosonic atoms where there is no long range interactions. We study a system of normal and hardcore boson mixture with only the former possessing long range interactions. We consider three cases: the first where the total density is commensurate and the other two where they are incommensurate . By suitable choices of the densities and the interaction strengths of the atoms, we predict that the charge density wave and the supersolid orders can be induced in the hardcore species as a result of the competing interatomic interactions.",cond
197,"Metal-insulator transitions in tetrahedral semiconductors under lattice
  change","Although most insulators are expected to undergo insulator to metal transition on lattice compression, tetrahedral semiconductors Si, GaAs and InSb can become metallic on compression as well as by expansion. We focus on the transition by expansion which is rather peculiar; in all cases the direct gap at $\Gamma$ point closes on expansion and thereafter a zero-gap state persists over a wide range of lattice constant. The solids become metallic at an expansion of 13 % to 15 % when an electron fermi surface around L-point and a hole fermi surface at $\Gamma$-point develop. We provide an understanding of this behavior in terms of arguments based on symmetry and simple tight-binding considerations. We also report results on the critical behavior of conductivity in the metal phase and the static dielectric constant in the insulating phase and find common behaviour. We consider the possibility of excitonic phases and distortions which might intervene between insulating and metallic phases.",cond
198,New model for surface fracture induced by dynamical stress,"We introduce a model where an isotropic, dynamically-imposed stress induces fracture in a thin film. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study how the integrated fragment distribution function depends on the rate of change and magnitude of the imposed stress, as well as on temperature. A mean-field argument shows that the system becomes unstable for a critical value of the stress. We find a striking invariance of the distribution of fragments for fixed ratio of temperature and rate of change of the stress; the interval over which this invariance holds is determined by the force fluctuations at the critical value of the stress.",cond
199,Jellium model of metallic nanocohesion,"A unified treatment of the cohesive and conducting properties of metallic nanostructures in terms of the electronic scattering matrix is developed. A simple picture of metallic nanocohesion in which conductance channels act as delocalized chemical bonds is derived in the jellium approximation. Universal force oscillations of order epsilon_F/lambda_F are predicted when a metallic quantum wire is stretched to the breaking point, which are synchronized with quantized jumps in the conductance.",cond
200,The Equilibrium Shape of Quantum Dots,"The formation of dislocation-free three-dimensional islands during the heteroepitaxial growth of lattice-mismatched materials has been observed experimentally for several material systems. The equilibrium shape of the islands is governed by the competition between the surface energy and the elastic relaxation energy of the islands as compared to the uniform strained film. As an exemplification we consider the experimentally intensively investigated growth of InAs quantum dots on a GaAs(001) substrate, deriving the equilibrium shape as a function of island volume. For this purpose InAs surface energies have been calculated within density-functional theory, and a continuum approach has been applied to compute the elastic relaxation energies.",cond

203,"DRESS: Dynamic RESource-reservation Scheme for Congested Data-intensive
  Computing Platforms","In the past few years, we have envisioned an increasing number of businesses start driving by big data analytics, such as Amazon recommendations and Google Advertisements. At the back-end side, the businesses are powered by big data processing platforms to quickly extract information and make decisions. Running on top of a computing cluster, those platforms utilize scheduling algorithms to allocate resources. An efficient scheduler is crucial to the system performance due to limited resources, e.g. CPU and Memory, and a large number of user demands. However, besides requests from clients and current status of the system, it has limited knowledge about execution length of the running jobs, and incoming jobs' resource demands, which make assigning resources a challenging task. If most of the resources are occupied by a long-running job, other jobs will have to keep waiting until it releases them. This paper presents a new scheduling strategy, named DRESS that particularly aims to optimize the allocation among jobs with various demands. Specifically, it classifies the jobs into two categories based on their requests, reserves a portion of resources for each of category, and dynamically adjusts the reserved ratio by monitoring the pending requests and estimating release patterns of running jobs. The results demonstrate DRESS significantly reduces the completion time for one category, up to 76.1% in our experiments, and in the meanwhile, maintains a stable overall system performance.",cs
204,MRI/TRUS data fusion for brachytherapy,"BACKGROUND: Prostate brachytherapy consists in placing radioactive seeds for tumour destruction under transrectal ultrasound imaging (TRUS) control. It requires prostate delineation from the images for dose planning. Because ultrasound imaging is patient- and operator-dependent, we have proposed to fuse MRI data to TRUS data to make image processing more reliable. The technical accuracy of this approach has already been evaluated. METHODS: We present work in progress concerning the evaluation of the approach from the dosimetry viewpoint. The objective is to determine what impact this system may have on the treatment of the patient. Dose planning is performed from initial TRUS prostate contours and evaluated on contours modified by data fusion. RESULTS: For the eight patients included, we demonstrate that TRUS prostate volume is most often underestimated and that dose is overestimated in a correlated way. However, dose constraints are still verified for those eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: This confirms our initial hypothesis.",cs
205,"A logical analysis of entanglement and separability in quantum
  higher-order functions",We present a logical separability analysis for a functional quantum computation language. This logic is inspired by previous works on logical analysis of aliasing for imperative functional programs. Both analyses share similarities notably because they are highly non-compositional. Quantum setting is harder to deal with since it introduces non determinism and thus considerably modifies semantics and validity of logical assertions. This logic is the first proposal of entanglement/separability analysis dealing with a functional quantum programming language with higher-order functions.,cs
206,Thinking Twice about Second-Price Ad Auctions,"Recent work has addressed the algorithmic problem of allocating advertisement space for keywords in sponsored search auctions so as to maximize revenue, most of which assume that pricing is done via a first-price auction. This does not realistically model the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction used in practice, in which bidders pay the next-highest bid for keywords that they are allocated. Towards the goal of more realistically modeling these auctions, we introduce the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem, in which bidders' payments are determined by the GSP mechanism. We show that the complexity of the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem is quite different than that of the more studied First-Price Ad Auctions problem. First, unlike the first-price variant, for which small constant-factor approximations are known, it is NP-hard to approximate the Second-Price Ad Auctions problem to any non-trivial factor, even when the bids are small compared to the budgets. Second, this discrepancy extends even to the 0-1 special case that we call the Second-Price Matching problem (2PM). Offline 2PM is APX-hard, and for online 2PM there is no deterministic algorithm achieving a non-trivial competitive ratio and no randomized algorithm achieving a competitive ratio better than 2. This contrasts with the results for the analogous special case in the first-price model, the standard bipartite matching problem, which is solvable in polynomial time and which has deterministic and randomized online algorithms achieving better competitive ratios. On the positive side, we provide a 2-approximation for offline 2PM and a 5.083-competitive randomized algorithm for online 2PM. The latter result makes use of a new generalization of a result on the performance of the ""Ranking"" algorithm for online bipartite matching.",cs
207,Robust Chemical Circuits,"We introduce a new motif for constructing robust digital logic circuits using input/output chemical reaction networks. These chemical circuits robustly handle perturbations in input signals, initial concentrations, rate constants, and measurements. In particular, we show that all combinatorial circuits and several sequential circuits enjoy this robustness. Our results complement existing literature in the following three ways: (1) our logic gates read their inputs catalytically which make `fanout' gates unnecessary; (2) formal requirements and rigorous proofs of satisfaction are provided for each circuit; and (3) robustness of every circuit is closed under modular composition.",cs
208,The pre-history of quantum computation,The main ideas behind developments in the theory and technology of quantum computation were formulated in the late 1970s and early 1980s by two physicists in the West and a mathematician in the former Soviet Union. It is not generally known in the West that the subject has roots in the Russian technical literature. The author hopes to present as impartial a synthesis as possible of the early history of thought on this subject. The role of reversible and irreversible computational processes is examined briefly as it relates to the origins of quantum computing and the so-called Information Paradox in physics.,cs

To accelerate commercialisation of RF MEMS products, development for packaging technologies is one of the most critical issues should be solved beforehand.",cs
210,Voice vs Data: Estimates of Media Usage and Network Traffic,"The popular conception is that data traffic nearly, if not already, exceeds voice traffic on backbone networks. However, the results of research reported in this paper imply that voice traffic greatly exceeds data traffic when real users are asked to estimate their usage of a wide variety of media. Media usage was surveyed for students in New York City and in Los Angeles. Other than significant differences in radio listening, e-mails, and downloads, the usage was quite similar. Telephone usage (wired and wireless) was nearly an hour per day. When converted to bits, the telephone traffic was much greater than the data traffic over the Internet. This paper reports on the details of the two user studies. The traffic implications of the results are estimated. The finding that voice exceeds data will then be reconciled with the popular opposite conception.",cs
211,Introduction to Functional Grammars,"Formal grammars are extensively used in Computer Science and related fields to study the rules which govern production of a language. The use of these grammars can be extended beyond mere language production. One possibility is to view these grammars as logical machines, similar to automata, which can be modified to compute or help in computation, while also performing the basic task of language production. The difference between such a modified grammar and an automaton will then lie in the semantics of computation performed. It is even possible for such a grammar to appear non-functional (when no language is produced as a result of its productions), but in reality, it might be carrying out important tasks. Such grammars have been named Functional Grammars (including a special sub-category, called Virtual Grammars), and their properties are studied in the paper.",cs

213,Exact Complexity of the Winner Problem for Young Elections,"In 1977, Young proposed a voting scheme that extends the Condorcet Principle based on the fewest possible number of voters whose removal yields a Condorcet winner. We prove that both the winner and the ranking problem for Young elections is complete for the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by parallel access to NP. Analogous results for Lewis Carroll's 1876 voting scheme were recently established by Hemaspaandra et al. In contrast, we prove that the winner and ranking problems in Fishburn's homogeneous variant of Carroll's voting scheme can be solved efficiently by linear programming.",cs
214,"Simultaneous Perturbation Methods for Adaptive Labor Staffing in Service
  Systems","Service systems are labor intensive due to the large variation in the tasks required to address service requests from multiple customers. Aligning the staffing levels to the forecasted workloads adaptively in such systems is nontrivial because of a large number of parameters and operational variations leading to a huge search space. A challenging problem here is to optimize the staffing while maintaining the system in steady-state and compliant to aggregate service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Further, because these parameters change on a weekly basis, the optimization should not take longer than a few hours. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov cost process parameterized by the (discrete) staffing levels. We propose novel simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) based SASOC (Staff Allocation using Stochastic Optimization with Constraints) algorithms for solving the above problem. The algorithms include both first order as well as second order methods and incorporate SPSA based gradient estimates in the primal, with dual ascent for the Lagrange multipliers. Both the algorithms that we propose are online, incremental and easy to implement. Further, they involve a certain generalized smooth projection operator, which is essential to project the continuous-valued worker parameter tuned by SASOC algorithms onto the discrete set. We validated our algorithms on five real-life service systems and compared them with a state-of-the-art optimization tool-kit OptQuest. Being 25 times faster than OptQuest, our algorithms are particularly suitable for adaptive labor staffing. Also, we observe that our algorithms guarantee convergence and find better solutions than OptQuest in many cases.",cs
215,Querying and Manipulating Temporal Databases,"Many works have focused, for over twenty five years, on the integration of the time dimension in databases (DB). However, the standard SQL3 does not yet allow easy definition, manipulation and querying of temporal DBs. In this paper, we study how we can simplify querying and manipulating temporal facts in SQL3, using a model that integrates time in a native manner. To do this, we propose new keywords and syntax to define different temporal versions for many relational operators and functions used in SQL. It then becomes possible to perform various queries and updates appropriate to temporal facts. We illustrate the use of these proposals on many examples from a real application.",cs
216,"Modeling of a Reconfigurable OFDM IP Block Family For an RF System
  Simulator","The idea of design domain specific Mother Model of IP block family as a base of modeling of system integration is presented here. A common reconfigurable Mother Model for ten different standardized digital OFDM transmitters has been developed. By means of a set of parameters, the mother model can be reconfigured to any of the ten selected standards. So far the applicability of the proposed reconfiguration and analog-digital co-modeling methods have been proved by modeling the function of the digital parts of three, 802.11a, ADSL and DRM, transmitters in an RF system simulator. The model is intended to be used as signal source template in RF system simulations. The concept is not restricted to signal sources, it can be applied to any IP block development. The idea of the Mother Model will be applied in other design domains to prove that in certain application areas, OFDM transceivers in this case, the design process can progress simultaneously in different design domains - mixed signal, system and RTL-architectural - without the need of high-level synthesis. Only the Mother Models of three design domains are needed to be formally proved to function as specified.",cs
217,"PLTL Partitioned Model Checking for Reactive Systems under Fairness
  Assumptions","We are interested in verifying dynamic properties of finite state reactive systems under fairness assumptions by model checking. The systems we want to verify are specified through a top-down refinement process. In order to deal with the state explosion problem, we have proposed in previous works to partition the reachability graph, and to perform the verification on each part separately. Moreover, we have defined a class, called Bmod, of dynamic properties that are verifiable by parts, whatever the partition. We decide if a property P belongs to Bmod by looking at the form of the Buchi automaton that accepts the negation of P. However, when a property P belongs to Bmod, the property f => P, where f is a fairness assumption, does not necessarily belong to Bmod. In this paper, we propose to use the refinement process in order to build the parts on which the verification has to be performed. We then show that with such a partition, if a property P is verifiable by parts and if f is the expression of the fairness assumptions on a system, then the property f => P is still verifiable by parts. This approach is illustrated by its application to the chip card protocol T=1 using the B engineering design language.",cs
218,Quantifying and Visualizing Attribute Interactions,"Interactions are patterns between several attributes in data that cannot be inferred from any subset of these attributes. While mutual information is a well-established approach to evaluating the interactions between two attributes, we surveyed its generalizations as to quantify interactions between several attributes. We have chosen McGill's interaction information, which has been independently rediscovered a number of times under various names in various disciplines, because of its many intuitively appealing properties. We apply interaction information to visually present the most important interactions of the data. Visualization of interactions has provided insight into the structure of data on a number of domains, identifying redundant attributes and opportunities for constructing new features, discovering unexpected regularities in data, and have helped during construction of predictive models; we illustrate the methods on numerous examples. A machine learning method that disregards interactions may get caught in two traps: myopia is caused by learning algorithms assuming independence in spite of interactions, whereas fragmentation arises from assuming an interaction in spite of independence.",cs
219,A Generic Approach to Coalition Formation,"We propose an abstract approach to coalition formation that focuses on simple merge and split rules transforming partitions of a group of players. We identify conditions under which every iteration of these rules yields a unique partition. The main conceptual tool is a specific notion of a stable partition. The results are parametrized by a preference relation between partitions of a group of players and naturally apply to coalitional TU-games, hedonic games and exchange economy games.",cs
220,Adaptive Software Radio Steganography,"This paper presents an adaptable steganography (information hiding) method for digital radio communication. Many radio steganography methods exist, but most are defined at higher levels of the protocol stack and are thus protocol dependent. In contrast, this method is defined at the physical layer, which makes it widely applicable regardless of the protocols used at higher layers. This approach is also adaptive; the covertness of the hidden channel is simple to control via a single continuous parameter either manually or automatically. Several variations are introduced, each with performance evaluated by simulation. Results show this to be a feasible method with a reasonable trade-off between performance and covertness.",cs
221,"Text/Graphics Separation and Skew Correction of Text Regions of Business
  Card Images for Mobile Devices","Separation of the text regions from background texture and graphics is an important step of any optical character recognition system for the images containing both texts and graphics. In this paper, we have presented a novel text/graphics separation technique and a method for skew correction of text regions extracted from business card images captured with a cell-phone camera. At first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level based on intensity variance. This makes the foreground components distinct from each other. Then the non-text components are removed using various characteristic features of text and graphics. Finally, the text regions are skew corrected for further processing. Experimenting with business card images of various resolutions, we have found an optimum performance of 98.25% (recall) with 0.75 MP images, that takes 0.17 seconds processing time and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately powerful computer (DualCore 1.73 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache). The developed technique is computationally efficient and consumes low memory so as to be applicable on mobile devices.",cs
222,Long-Term Mentoring for Computer Science Researchers,"Early in the pandemic, we -- leaders in the research areas of programming languages (PL) and computer architecture (CA) -- realized that we had a problem: the only way to form new lasting connections in the community was to already have lasting connections in the community. Both of our academic communities had wonderful short-term mentoring programs to address this problem, but it was clear that we needed long-term mentoring programs.   Those of us in CA approached this scientifically, making an evidence-backed case for community-wide long-term mentoring. In the meantime, one of us in PL had impulsively launched an unofficial long-term mentoring program, founded on chaos and spreadsheets. In January 2021, the latter grew to an official cross-institutional long-term mentoring program called SIGPLAN-M; in January 2022, the former grew to Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM).   The impacts have been strong: SIGPLAN-M reaches 328 mentees and 234 mentors across 41 countries, and mentees have described it as ""life changing"" and ""a career saver."" And while CALM is in its pilot phase -- with 13 mentors and 21 mentees across 7 countries -- it has received very positive feedback. The leaders of SIGPLAN-M and CALM shared our designs, impacts, and challenges along the way. Now, we wish to share those with you. We hope this will kick-start a larger long-term mentoring effort across all of computer science.",cs

We present in this paper, an approach for building a Web-based system for observing and analyzing user activity on any type of discussion forums.",cs
225,"The Conceptual Integration Modeling Framework: Abstracting from the
  Multidimensional Model","Data warehouses are overwhelmingly built through a bottom-up process, which starts with the identification of sources, continues with the extraction and transformation of data from these sources, and then loads the data into a set of data marts according to desired multidimensional relational schemas. End user business intelligence tools are added on top of the materialized multidimensional schemas to drive decision making in an organization. Unfortunately, this bottom-up approach is costly both in terms of the skilled users needed and the sheer size of the warehouses. This paper proposes a top-down framework in which data warehousing is driven by a conceptual model. The framework offers both design time and run time environments. At design time, a business user first uses the conceptual modeling language as a multidimensional object model to specify what business information is needed; then she maps the conceptual model to a pre-existing logical multidimensional representation. At run time, a system will transform the user conceptual model together with the mappings into views over the logical multidimensional representation. We focus on how the user can conceptually abstract from an existing data warehouse, and on how this conceptual model can be mapped to the logical multidimensional representation. We also give an indication of what query language is used over the conceptual model. Finally, we argue that our framework is a step along the way to allowing automatic generation of the data warehouse.",cs

227,Minimisation of Multiplicity Tree Automata,"We consider the problem of minimising the number of states in a multiplicity tree automaton over the field of rational numbers. We give a minimisation algorithm that runs in polynomial time assuming unit-cost arithmetic. We also show that a polynomial bound in the standard Turing model would require a breakthrough in the complexity of polynomial identity testing by proving that the latter problem is logspace equivalent to the decision version of minimisation. The developed techniques also improve the state of the art in multiplicity word automata: we give an NC algorithm for minimising multiplicity word automata. Finally, we consider the minimal consistency problem: does there exist an automaton with $n$ states that is consistent with a given finite sample of weight-labelled words or trees? We show that this decision problem is complete for the existential theory of the rationals, both for words and for trees of a fixed alphabet rank.",cs
228,The 12 prophets dataset,"The ""Ajeijadinho 3D"" project is an initiative supported by the University of S\~ao Paulo (Museum of Science and Dean of Culture and Extension), which involves the 3D digitization of art works of Brazilian sculptor Antonio Francisco Lisboa, better known as Aleijadinho. The project made use of advanced acquisition and processing of 3D meshes for preservation and dissemination of the cultural heritage. The dissemination occurs through a Web portal, so that the population has the opportunity to meet the art works in detail using 3D visualization and interaction. The portal address is http://www.aleijadinho3d.icmc.usp.br. The 3D acquisitions were conducted over a week at the end of July 2013 in the cities of Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil and Congonhas do Campo, MG, Brazil. The scanning was done with a special equipment supplied by company Leica Geosystems, which allowed the work to take place at distances between 10 and 30 meters, defining a non-invasive procedure, simplified logistics, and without the need for preparation or isolation of the sites. In Ouro Preto, we digitized the churches of Francisco of Assis, Our Lady of Carmo, and Our Lady of Mercy; in Congonhas do Campo we scanned the entire Sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos and his 12 prophets. Once scanned, the art works went through a long process of preparation, which required careful handling of meshes done by experts from the University of S\~ao Paulo in partnership with company Imprimate.",cs

This family is constructed as an editing distance whose elementary operations apply on linear segments. A specific parameter allows controlling the stiffness of the elastic matching.

231,"Design of Attitude Stability System for Prolate Dual-spin Satellite in
  Its Inclined Elliptical Orbit","In general, most of communication satellites were designed to be operated in geostationary orbit. And many of them were designed in prolate dual-spin configuration. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, they have to be stabilized against their internal energy dissipation effect. Several countries that located in southern hemisphere, has shown interest to use communication satellite. Because of those countries southern latitude, an idea emerged to incline the communication satellite (due to its prolate dualspin configuration) in elliptical orbit. This work is focused on designing Attitude Stability System for prolate dual-spin satellite in the effect of perturbed field of gravity due to the inclination of its elliptical orbit. DANDE (De-spin Active Nutation Damping Electronics) provides primary stabilization method for the satellite in its orbit. Classical Control Approach is used for the iteration of DANDE parameters. The control performance is evaluated based on time response analysis.",cs
232,Capacity with Causal and Non-Causal Side Information - A Unified View,"We identify the common underlying form of the capacity expression that is applicable to both cases where causal or non-causal side information is made available to the transmitter. Using this common form we find that for the single user channel, the multiple access channel, the degraded broadcast channel, and the degraded relay channel, the sum capacity with causal and non-causal side information are identical when all the transmitter side information is also made available to all the receivers. A genie-aided outerbound is developed that states that when a genie provides $n$ bits of side information to a receiver the resulting capacity improvement can not be more than $n$ bits. Combining these two results we are able to bound the relative capacity advantage of non-causal side information over causal side information for both single user as well as various multiple user communication scenarios. Applications of these capacity bounds are demonstrated through examples of random access channels. Interestingly, the capacity results indicate that the excessive MAC layer overheads common in present wireless systems may be avoided through coding across multiple access blocks. It is also shown that even one bit of side information at the transmitter can result in unbounded capacity improvement. As a side, we obtain the sum capacity for a multiple access channel when the side information available to the transmitter is causal and possibly correlated to the side information available to the receiver.",cs
233,Ultimate approximations in nonmonotonic knowledge representation systems,"We study fixpoints of operators on lattices. To this end we introduce the notion of an approximation of an operator. We order approximations by means of a precision ordering. We show that each lattice operator O has a unique most precise or ultimate approximation. We demonstrate that fixpoints of this ultimate approximation provide useful insights into fixpoints of the operator O.   We apply our theory to logic programming and introduce the ultimate Kripke-Kleene, well-founded and stable semantics. We show that the ultimate Kripke-Kleene and well-founded semantics are more precise then their standard counterparts We argue that ultimate semantics for logic programming have attractive epistemological properties and that, while in general they are computationally more complex than the standard semantics, for many classes of theories, their complexity is no worse.",cs

It seeks to provide easy and interactive tools for data visualization that fit with the scientific user's workflow. For this purpose, Mayavi provides several entry points: a full-blown interactive application; a Python library with both a MATLAB-like interface focused on easy scripting and a feature-rich object hierarchy; widgets associated with these objects for assembling in a domain-specific application, and plugins that work with a general purpose application-building framework.

235,"Symbolic Algorithms for Qualitative Analysis of Markov Decision
  Processes with Büchi Objectives","We consider Markov decision processes (MDPs) with \omega-regular specifications given as parity objectives. We consider the problem of computing the set of almost-sure winning states from where the objective can be ensured with probability 1. The algorithms for the computation of the almost-sure winning set for parity objectives iteratively use the solutions for the almost-sure winning set for B\""uchi objectives (a special case of parity objectives). Our contributions are as follows: First, we present the first subquadratic symbolic algorithm to compute the almost-sure winning set for MDPs with B\""uchi objectives; our algorithm takes O(n \sqrt{m}) symbolic steps as compared to the previous known algorithm that takes O(n^2) symbolic steps, where $n$ is the number of states and $m$ is the number of edges of the MDP. In practice MDPs have constant out-degree, and then our symbolic algorithm takes O(n \sqrt{n}) symbolic steps, as compared to the previous known $O(n^2)$ symbolic steps algorithm. Second, we present a new algorithm, namely win-lose algorithm, with the following two properties: (a) the algorithm iteratively computes subsets of the almost-sure winning set and its complement, as compared to all previous algorithms that discover the almost-sure winning set upon termination; and (b) requires O(n \sqrt{K}) symbolic steps, where K is the maximal number of edges of strongly connected components (scc's) of the MDP. The win-lose algorithm requires symbolic computation of scc's. Third, we improve the algorithm for symbolic scc computation; the previous known algorithm takes linear symbolic steps, and our new algorithm improves the constants associated with the linear number of steps. In the worst case the previous known algorithm takes 5n symbolic steps, whereas our new algorithm takes 4n symbolic steps.",cs
236,"A process planning system with feature based neural network search
  strategy for aluminum extrusion die manufacturing","Aluminum extrusion die manufacturing is a critical task for productive improvement and increasing potential of competition in aluminum extrusion industry. It causes to meet the efficiency not only consistent quality but also time and production cost reduction. Die manufacturing consists first of die design and process planning in order to make a die for extruding the customer's requirement products. The efficiency of die design and process planning are based on the knowledge and experience of die design and die manufacturer experts. This knowledge has been formulated into a computer system called the knowledge-based system. It can be reused to support a new die design and process planning. Such knowledge can be extracted directly from die geometry which is composed of die features. These features are stored in die feature library to be prepared for producing a new die manufacturing. Die geometry is defined according to the characteristics of the profile so we can reuse die features from the previous similar profile design cases. This paper presents the CaseXpert Process Planning System for die manufacturing based on feature based neural network technique. Die manufacturing cases in the case library would be retrieved with searching and learning method by neural network for reusing or revising it to build a die design and process planning when a new case is similar with the previous die manufacturing cases. The results of the system are dies design and machining process. The system has been successfully tested, it has been proved that the system can reduce planning time and respond high consistent plans.",cs

238,"Approximate fast graph Fourier transforms via multi-layer sparse
  approximations","The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm of paramount importance in signal processing as it allows to apply the Fourier transform in O(n log n) instead of O(n 2) arithmetic operations. Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a recent research domain that generalizes classical signal processing tools, such as the Fourier transform, to situations where the signal domain is given by any arbitrary graph instead of a regular grid. Today, there is no method to rapidly apply graph Fourier transforms. We propose in this paper a method to obtain approximate graph Fourier transforms that can be applied rapidly and stored efficiently. It is based on a greedy approximate diagonalization of the graph Laplacian matrix, carried out using a modified version of the famous Jacobi eigenvalues algorithm. The method is described and analyzed in detail, and then applied to both synthetic and real graphs, showing its potential.",cs

We will illustrate the details of these schemes, and perform analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, respectively.",cs
240,"Synergizing Roadway Infrastructure Investment with Digital
  Infrastructure for Infrastructure-Based Connected Vehicle Applications:
  Review of Current Status and Future Directions","The safety, mobility, environmental, energy, and economic benefits of transportation systems, which are the focus of recent connected vehicle (CV) programs, are potentially dramatic. However, realization of these benefits largely hinges on the timely integration of digital technology into upcoming as well as existing transportation infrastructure. CVs must be enabled to broadcast and receive data to and from other CVs [vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication], to and from infrastructure [vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication], and to and from other road users, such as bicyclists or pedestrians (vehicle-to-other road users communication). Further, the infrastructure and transportation agencies that manage V2I-focused applications must be able to collect, process, distribute, and archive these data quickly, reliably, and securely. This paper focuses on V2I applications and investigates current digital roadway infrastructure initiatives. It highlights the importance of including digital infrastructure investment alongside investment in more traditional transportation infrastructure to keep up with the auto industry push toward increasing intervehicular communication. By studying current CV testbeds and smart-city initiatives, this paper identifies digital infrastructure being used by public agencies. It also examines public agencies limited budgeting for digital infrastructure and finds that current expenditure is inadequate for realizing the potential benefits of V2I applications. Finally, the paper presents a set of recommendations, based on a review of current practices and future needs, designed to guide agencies responsible for transportation infrastructure. It stresses the importance of collaboration for establishing national and international platforms for the planning, deployment, and management of digital infrastructure to support connected transportation systems.",cs
241,Normal forms for Answer Sets Programming,"Normal forms for logic programs under stable/answer set semantics are introduced. We argue that these forms can simplify the study of program properties, mainly consistency. The first normal form, called the {\em kernel} of the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets. The body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form tends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, it is possible to check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the Extended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed. The second normal form is called {\em 3-kernel.} A 3-kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics. Rules in 3-kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to a cycle, or defines a connection between cycles. 3-kernel programs may have positive conditions. The 3-kernel normal form is very useful for the static analysis of program consistency, i.e., the syntactic characterization of existence of answer sets. This result can be obtained thanks to a novel graph-like representation of programs, called Cycle Graph which presented in the companion article \cite{Cos04b}.",cs
242,MammoGrid: Large-Scale Distributed Mammogram Analysis,"Breast cancer as a medical condition and mammograms as images exhibit many dimensions of variability across the population. Similarly, the way diagnostic systems are used and maintained by clinicians varies between imaging centres and breast screening programmes, and so does the appearance of the mammograms generated. A distributed database that reflects the spread of pathologies across the population is an invaluable tool for the epidemiologist and the understanding of the variation in image acquisition protocols is essential to a radiologist in a screening programme. Exploiting emerging grid technology, the aim of the MammoGrid [1] project is to develop a Europe-wide database of mammograms that will be used to investigate a set of important healthcare applications and to explore the potential of the grid to support effective co-working between healthcare professionals.",cs
243,"Relations, Constraints and Abstractions: Using the Tools of Logic
  Programming in the Security Industry","Logic programming is sometimes described as relational programming: a paradigm in which the programmer specifies and composes n-ary relations using systems of constraints. An advanced logic programming environment will provide tools that abstract these relations to transform, optimise, or even verify the correctness of a logic program. This talk will show that these concepts, namely relations, constraints and abstractions, turn out to also be important in the reverse engineer process that underpins the discovery of bugs within the security industry.",cs
244,A Second Order Derivatives based Approach for Steganography,"Steganography schemes are designed with the objective of minimizing a defined distortion function. In most existing state of the art approaches, this distortion function is based on image feature preservation. Since smooth regions or clean edges define image core, even a small modification in these areas largely modifies image features and is thus easily detectable. On the contrary, textures, noisy or chaotic regions are so difficult to model that the features having been modified inside these areas are similar to the initial ones. These regions are characterized by disturbed level curves. This work presents a new distortion function for steganography that is based on second order derivatives, which are mathematical tools that usually evaluate level curves. Two methods are explained to compute these partial derivatives and have been completely implemented. The first experiments show that these approaches are promising.",cs
245,A Survey on 3D CAD model quality assurance and testing tools,"A new taxonomy of issues related to CAD model quality is presented, which distinguishes between explicit and procedural models. For each type of model, morphologic, syntactic, and semantic errors are characterized. The taxonomy was validated successfully when used to classify quality testing tools, which are aimed at detecting and repairing data errors that may affect the simplification, interoperability, and reusability of CAD models. The study shows that low semantic level errors that hamper simplification are reasonably covered in explicit representations, although many CAD quality testers are still unaffordable for Small and Medium Enterprises, both in terms of cost and training time. Interoperability has been reasonably solved by standards like STEP AP 203 and AP214, but model reusability is not feasible in explicit representations. Procedural representations are promising, as interactive modeling editors automatically prevent most morphologic errors derived from unsuitable modeling strategies. Interoperability problems between procedural representations are expected to decrease dramatically with STEP AP242. Higher semantic aspects of quality such as assurance of design intent, however, are hardly supported by current CAD quality testers.",cs
246,"Discrete-time Queueing Model of Age of Information with Multiple
  Information Sources","Information freshness in IoT-based status update systems has recently been studied through the Age of Information (AoI) and Peak AoI (PAoI) performance metrics. In this paper, we study a discrete-time server arising in multi-source IoT systems which accepts incoming information packets from multiple information sources so as to be forwarded to a remote monitor for status update purposes. Under the assumption of Bernoulli information packet arrivals and a common geometric service time distribution across all the sources, we numerically obtain the exact per-source distributions of AoI and PAoI in matrix-geometric form for three different queueing disciplines: i) Non-Preemptive Bufferless (NPB) ii) Preemptive Bufferless (PB) iii) Non-Preemptive Single Buffer with Replacement (NPSBR). The proposed numerical algorithm employs the theory of Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) of Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) type and is matrix analytical, i.e, the algorithm is based on numerically stable and efficient vector-matrix operations.Numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed queueing model. We also present a numerical example on the optimum choice of the Bernoulli parameters in a practical IoT system with two sources with diverse AoI requirements.",cs
247,Stochastic Modeling of Hybrid Cache Systems,"In recent years, there is an increasing demand of big memory systems so to perform large scale data analytics. Since DRAM memories are expensive, some researchers are suggesting to use other memory systems such as non-volatile memory (NVM) technology to build large-memory computing systems. However, whether the NVM technology can be a viable alternative (either economically and technically) to DRAM remains an open question. To answer this question, it is important to consider how to design a memory system from a ""system perspective"", that is, incorporating different performance characteristics and price ratios from hybrid memory devices.   This paper presents an analytical model of a ""hybrid page cache system"" so to understand the diverse design space and performance impact of a hybrid cache system. We consider (1) various architectural choices, (2) design strategies, and (3) configuration of different memory devices. Using this model, we provide guidelines on how to design hybrid page cache to reach a good trade-off between high system throughput (in I/O per sec or IOPS) and fast cache reactivity which is defined by the time to fill the cache. We also show how one can configure the DRAM capacity and NVM capacity under a fixed budget. We pick PCM as an example for NVM and conduct numerical analysis. Our analysis indicates that incorporating PCM in a page cache system significantly improves the system performance, and it also shows larger benefit to allocate more PCM in page cache in some cases. Besides, for the common setting of performance-price ratio of PCM, ""flat architecture"" offers as a better choice, but ""layered architecture"" outperforms if PCM write performance can be significantly improved in the future.",cs
248,Vocabulary Alignment in Openly Specified Interactions,"The problem of achieving common understanding between agents that use different vocabularies has been mainly addressed by designing techniques that explicitly negotiate mappings between their vocabularies, requiring agents to share a meta-language. In this paper we consider the case of agents that use different vocabularies and have no meta-language in common, but share the knowledge of how to perform a task, given by the specification of an interaction protocol. For this situation, we present a framework that lets agents learn a vocabulary alignment from the experience of interacting. Unlike previous work in this direction, we use open protocols that constrain possible actions instead of defining procedures, making our approach more general. We present two techniques that can be used either to learn an alignment from scratch or to repair an existent one, and we evaluate experimentally their performance.",cs
249,"A Pedagogical Evaluation and Discussion about the Lack of Cohesion in
  Method (LCOM) Metric Using Field Experiment","Chidamber and Kemerer first defined a cohesion measure for object-oriented software - the Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM) metric. This paper presents a pedagogic evaluation and discussion about the LCOM metric using field data from three industrial systems. System 1 has 34 classes, System 2 has 383 classes and System 3 has 1055 classes. The main objectives of the study were to determine if the LCOM metric was appropriate in the measurement of class cohesion and the determination of properly and improperly designed classes in the studied systems. Chidamber and Kemerer's suite of metric was used as metric tool. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze results. The result of the study showed that in System 1, 78.8% (26 classes) were cohesive; System 2 54% (207 classes) were cohesive; System 3 30% (317 classes) were cohesive. We suggest that the LCOM metric measures class cohesiveness and was appropriate in the determination of properly and improperly designed classes in the studied system.",cs
250,On the Expected Complexity of Voronoi Diagrams on Terrains,"We investigate the combinatorial complexity of geodesic Voronoi diagrams on polyhedral terrains using a probabilistic analysis. Aronov etal [ABT08] prove that, if one makes certain realistic input assumptions on the terrain, this complexity is \Theta(n + m \sqrt n) in the worst case, where n denotes the number of triangles that define the terrain and m denotes the number of Voronoi sites. We prove that under a relaxed set of assumptions the Voronoi diagram has expected complexity O(n+m), given that the sites have a uniform distribution on the domain of the terrain(or the surface of the terrain). Furthermore, we present a worst-case construction of a terrain which implies a lower bound of Vmega(n m2/3) on the expected worst-case complexity if these assumptions on the terrain are dropped. As an additional result, we can show that the expected fatness of a cell in a random planar Voronoi diagram is bounded by a constant.",cs
251,BlueOx: A Java Framework for Distributed Data Analysis,"High energy physics experiments including those at the Tevatron and the upcoming LHC require analysis of large data sets which are best handled by distributed computation. We present the design and development of a distributed data analysis framework based on Java. Analysis jobs run through three phases: discovery of data sets available, brokering/assignment of data sets to analysis servers, and job execution. Each phase is represented by a set of abstract interfaces. These interfaces allow different techniques to be used without modification to the framework. For example, the communications interface has been implemented by both a packet protocol and a SOAP-based scheme. User authentication can be provided either through simple passwords or through a GSI certificates system. Data from CMS HCAL Testbeams, the L3 LEP experiment, and a hypothetical high-energy linear collider experiment have been interfaced with the framework.",cs

253,"Cinematic Visualization of Multiresolution Data: Ytini for Adaptive Mesh
  Refinement in Houdini","We have entered the era of large multidimensional datasets represented by increasingly complex data structures. Current tools for scientific visualization are not optimized to efficiently and intuitively create cinematic production quality, time-evolving representations of numerical data for broad impact science communication via film, media, or journalism. To present such data in a cinematic environment, it is advantageous to develop methods that integrate these complex data structures into industry standard visual effects software packages, which provide a myriad of control features otherwise unavailable in traditional scientific visualization software. In this paper, we present the general methodology for the import and visualization of nested multiresolution datasets into commercially available visual effects software. We further provide a specific example of importing Adaptive Mesh Refinement data into the software Houdini. This paper builds on our previous work, which describes a method for using Houdini to visualize uniform Cartesian datasets.

255,A Comparison of Techniques for Sampling Web Pages,"As the World Wide Web is growing rapidly, it is getting increasingly challenging to gather representative information about it. Instead of crawling the web exhaustively one has to resort to other techniques like sampling to determine the properties of the web. A uniform random sample of the web would be useful to determine the percentage of web pages in a specific language, on a topic or in a top level domain. Unfortunately, no approach has been shown to sample the web pages in an unbiased way. Three promising web sampling algorithms are based on random walks. They each have been evaluated individually, but making a comparison on different data sets is not possible. We directly compare these algorithms in this paper. We performed three random walks on the web under the same conditions and analyzed their outcomes in detail. We discuss the strengths and the weaknesses of each algorithm and propose improvements based on experimental results.",cs

In this paper we examine the state of the DL domain after a decade of activity by applying social network analysis to the co-authorship network of the past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital library conferences. We base our analysis on a common binary undirectional network model to represent the co-authorship network, and from it we extract several established network measures. We also introduce a weighted directional network model to represent the co-authorship network, for which we define $AuthorRank$ as an indicator of the impact of an individual author in the network. The results are validated against conference program committee members in the same period. The results show clear advantages of PageRank and AuthorRank over degree, closeness and betweenness centrality metrics. We also investigate the amount and nature of international participation in Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL).",cs

260,"Selective Decoding in Associative Memories Based on Sparse-Clustered
  Networks","Associative memories are structures that can retrieve previously stored information given a partial input pattern instead of an explicit address as in indexed memories. A few hardware approaches have recently been introduced for a new family of associative memories based on Sparse-Clustered Networks (SCN) that show attractive features. These architectures are suitable for implementations with low retrieval latency, but are limited to small networks that store a few hundred data entries. In this paper, a new hardware architecture of SCNs is proposed that features a new data-storage technique as well as a method we refer to as Selective Decoding (SD-SCN). The SD-SCN has been implemented using a similar FPGA used in the previous efforts and achieves two orders of magnitude higher capacity, with no error-performance penalty but with the cost of few extra clock cycles per data access.",cs

262,6-cycle double covers of cubic graphs,"A cycle double cover (CDC) of an undirected graph is a collection of the graph's cycles such that every edge of the graph belongs to exactly two cycles. We describe a constructive method for generating all the cubic graphs that have a 6-CDC (a CDC in which every cycle has length 6). As an application of the method, we prove that all such graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle. A sense of direction is an edge labeling on graphs that follows a globally consistent scheme and is known to considerably reduce the complexity of several distributed problems. In [9], a particular instance of sense of direction, called a chordal sense of direction (CSD), is studied and the class of k-regular graphs that admit a CSD with exactly k labels (a minimal CSD) is analyzed. We now show that nearly all the cubic graphs in this class have a 6-CDC, the only exception being K4.",cs
263,A New Multilayered PCP and the Hardness of Hypergraph Vertex Cover,"Given a $k$-uniform hyper-graph, the E$k$-Vertex-Cover problem is to find the smallest subset of vertices that intersects every hyper-edge. We present a new multilayered PCP construction that extends the Raz verifier. This enables us to prove that E$k$-Vertex-Cover is NP-hard to approximate within factor $(k-1-\epsilon)$ for any $k \geq 3$ and any $\epsilon>0$. The result is essentially tight as this problem can be easily approximated within factor $k$. Our construction makes use of the biased Long-Code and is analyzed using combinatorial properties of $s$-wise $t$-intersecting families of subsets.",cs
264,On the Effect of Fading on Ad hoc Networking,"Most MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork) research assumes idealized propagation models. Experimental results have shown significant divergence from simulation results due to the effect of signal fading in realistic wireless communication channels. In this paper, we characterize the impact of fading on protocol performance. We first study the effect of fading on MAC performance and show that its effect can be dominating. One of our important conclusions is that eliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading. We also identify an unfairness problem that arises due to backoffs in the presence of fading. Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions between the MAC and routing layers. We identify several of these problems and make observations about effective approaches for addressing them. For example, the criteria for determining the best path should not only consider the link status but also the link order. In addition, because routing protocols rely on MAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route failure errors are often generated unnecessarily. Finally, because MAC level broadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading. We analyze these effects and outline preliminary solutions to them.",cs

The entire system consists of intelligent agents and communication system. Intelligent agents can be divided into three layers, the bottom layer, the middle layer and the upper layer. The design of the agent in different layer is analyzed in detail. Communication system is the bridge of multi-agent system (MAS). The transmission mode, selective communication and other principles are discussed to improve the transmission efficiency. Finally, some evaluations are proposed, which provides the design of MAS with reference.",cs
266,GNA: new framework for statistical data analysis,"We report on the status of GNA --- a new framework for fitting large-scale physical models. GNA utilizes the data flow concept within which a model is represented by a directed acyclic graph. Each node is an operation on an array (matrix multiplication, derivative or cross section calculation, etc). The framework enables the user to create flexible and efficient large-scale lazily evaluated models, handle large numbers of parameters, propagate parameters' uncertainties while taking into account possible correlations between them, fit models, and perform statistical analysis. The main goal of the paper is to give an overview of the main concepts and methods as well as reasons behind their design. Detailed technical information is to be published in further works.",cs
267,Quantifying the Impact of Parameter Tuning on Nature-Inspired Algorithms,"The problem of parameterization is often central to the effective deployment of nature-inspired algorithms. However, finding the optimal set of parameter values for a combination of problem instance and solution method is highly challenging, and few concrete guidelines exist on how and when such tuning may be performed. Previous work tends to either focus on a specific algorithm or use benchmark problems, and both of these restrictions limit the applicability of any findings. Here, we examine a number of different algorithms, and study them in a ""problem agnostic"" fashion (i.e., one that is not tied to specific instances) by considering their performance on fitness landscapes with varying characteristics. Using this approach, we make a number of observations on which algorithms may (or may not) benefit from tuning, and in which specific circumstances.",cs
268,Optimizing GoTools' Search Heuristics using Genetic Algorithms,"GoTools is a program which solves life & death problems in the game of Go. This paper describes experiments using a Genetic Algorithm to optimize heuristic weights used by GoTools' tree-search. The complete set of heuristic weights is composed of different subgroups, each of which can be optimized with a suitable fitness function. As a useful side product, an MPI interface for FreePascal was implemented to allow the use of a parallelized fitness function running on a Beowulf cluster. The aim of this exercise is to optimize the current version of GoTools, and to make tools available in preparation of an extension of GoTools for solving open boundary life & death problems, which will introduce more heuristic parameters to be fine tuned.",cs

Two aspects of condition monitoring process are considered: (1) feature extraction; and (2) condition classification. Feature extraction methods described and implemented are fractals, Kurtosis and Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients. Classification methods described and implemented are support vector machines (SVM), hidden Markov models (HMM), Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and extension neural networks (ENN). The effectiveness of these features were tested using SVM, HMM, GMM and ENN on condition monitoring of bearings and are found to give good results.",cs

271,On modelling the emergence of logical thinking,"Recent progress in machine learning techniques have revived interest in building artificial general intelligence using these particular tools. There has been a tremendous success in applying them for narrow intellectual tasks such as pattern recognition, natural language processing and playing Go. The latter application vastly outperforms the strongest human player in recent years. However, these tasks are formalized by people in such ways that it has become ""easy"" for automated recipes to find better solutions than humans do. In the sense of John Searle's Chinese Room Argument, the computer playing Go does not actually understand anything from the game. Thinking like a human mind requires to go beyond the curve fitting paradigm of current systems. There is a fundamental limit to what they can achieve currently as only very specific problem formalization can increase their performances in particular tasks. In this paper, we argue than one of the most important aspects of the human mind is its capacity for logical thinking, which gives rise to many intellectual expressions that differentiate us from animal brains. We propose to model the emergence of logical thinking based on Piaget's theory of cognitive development.",cs

  per Element","The running maximum-minimum (max-min) filter computes the maxima and minima over running windows of size w. This filter has numerous applications in signal processing and time series analysis. We present an easy-to-implement online algorithm requiring no more than 3 comparisons per element, in the worst case. Comparatively, no algorithm is known to compute the running maximum (or minimum) filter in 1.5 comparisons per element, in the worst case. Our algorithm has reduced latency and memory usage.",cs
273,HPA: An Opportunistic Approach to Embedded Energy Efficiency,"Reducing energy consumption is a challenge that is faced on a daily basis by teams from the High-Performance Computing as well as the Embedded domain. This issue is mostly attacked from an hardware perspective, by devising architectures that put energy efficiency as a primary target, often at the cost of processing power. Lately, computing platforms have become more and more heterogeneous, but the exploitation of these additional capabilities is so complex from the application developer's perspective that they are left unused most of the time, resulting therefore in a supplemental waste of energy rather than in faster processing times.   In this paper we present a transparent, on-the-fly optimization scheme that allows a generic application to automatically exploit the available computing units to partition its computational load. We have called our approach Heterogeneous Platform Accelerator (HPA). The idea is to use profiling to automatically select a computing-intensive candidate for acceleration, and then distribute the computations to the different units by off-loading blocks of code to them.   Using an NVIDIA Jetson TK1 board, we demonstrate that not only HPA results in faster processing speed, but also in a considerable reduction in the total energy absorbed.",cs
274,Automatically Creating Design Models from 3D Anthropometry Data,"When designing a product that needs to fit the human shape, designers often use a small set of 3D models, called design models, either in physical or digital form, as representative shapes to cover the shape variabilities of the population for which the products are designed. Until recently, the process of creating these models has been an art involving manual interaction and empirical guesswork. The availability of the 3D anthropometric databases provides an opportunity to create design models optimally. In this paper, we propose a novel way to use 3D anthropometric databases to generate design models that represent a given population for design applications such as the sizing of garments and gear. We generate the representative shapes by solving a covering problem in a parameter space. Well-known techniques in computational geometry are used to solve this problem. We demonstrate the method using examples in designing glasses and helmets.",cs

276,PT-Scotch: A tool for efficient parallel graph ordering,"The parallel ordering of large graphs is a difficult problem, because on the one hand minimum degree algorithms do not parallelize well, and on the other hand the obtainment of high quality orderings with the nested dissection algorithm requires efficient graph bipartitioning heuristics, the best sequential implementations of which are also hard to parallelize. This paper presents a set of algorithms, implemented in the PT-Scotch software package, which allows one to order large graphs in parallel, yielding orderings the quality of which is only slightly worse than the one of state-of-the-art sequential algorithms. Our implementation uses the classical nested dissection approach but relies on several novel features to solve the parallel graph bipartitioning problem. Thanks to these improvements, PT-Scotch produces consistently better orderings than ParMeTiS on large numbers of processors.",cs
277,"AMIEDoT: An annotation model for document tracking and recommendation
  service","The primary objective of document annotation in whatever form, manual or electronic is to allow those who may not have control to original document to provide personal view on information source. Beyond providing personal assessment to original information sources, we are looking at a situation where annotation made can be used as additional source of information for document tracking and recommendation service. Most of the annotation tools existing today were conceived for their independent use with no reference to the creator of the annotation. We propose AMIEDoT (Annotation Model for Information Exchange and Document Tracking) an annotation model that can assist in document tracking and recommendation service. The model is based on three parameters in the acts of annotation. We believe that introducing document parameters, time and the parameters of the creator of annotation into an annotation process can be a dependable source to know, who used a document, when a document was used and for what a document was used for. Beyond document tracking, our model can be used in not only for selective dissemination of information but for recommendation services. AMIEDoT can also be used for information sharing and information reuse.",cs
278,Energy Efficiency and Delay Quality-of-Service in Wireless Networks,"The energy-delay tradeoffs in wireless networks are studied using a game-theoretic framework. A multi-class multiple-access network is considered in which users choose their transmit powers, and possibly transmission rates, in a distributed manner to maximize their own utilities while satisfying their delay quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per Joule of energy consumed and is particularly useful for energy-constrained networks. The Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed non-cooperative game is presented and closed-form expressions for the users' utilities at equilibrium are obtained. Based on this, the losses in energy efficiency and network capacity due to presence of delay-sensitive users are quantified. The analysis is extended to the scenario where the QoS requirements include both the average source rate and a bound on the average total delay (including queuing delay). It is shown that the incoming traffic rate and the delay constraint of a user translate into a ""size"" for the user, which is an indication of the amount of resources consumed by the user. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among throughput, delay, network capacity and energy efficiency are also quantified.",cs

In order to improve the quality of the resulted codebook, we combine the improved AP (IAP) with the conventional LBG algorithm to generate an effective algorithm call IAP-LBG. According to the experimental results, the proposed method not only enhances the convergence abilities but also is capable of providing higher-quality codebooks than conventional LBG method.",cs
280,"Spoofing Detection Goes Noisy: An Analysis of Synthetic Speech Detection
  in the Presence of Additive Noise","Automatic speaker verification (ASV) technology is recently finding its way to end-user applications for secure access to personal data, smart services or physical facilities. Similar to other biometric technologies, speaker verification is vulnerable to spoofing attacks where an attacker masquerades as a particular target speaker via impersonation, replay, text-to-speech (TTS) or voice conversion (VC) techniques to gain illegitimate access to the system. We focus on TTS and VC that represent the most flexible, high-end spoofing attacks. Most of the prior studies on synthesized or converted speech detection report their findings using high-quality clean recordings. Meanwhile, the performance of spoofing detectors in the presence of additive noise, an important consideration in practical ASV implementations, remains largely unknown. To this end, we analyze the suitability of state-of-the-art synthetic speech detectors under additive noise with a special focus on front-end features. Our comparison includes eight acoustic feature sets, five related to spectral magnitude and three to spectral phase information. Our extensive experiments on ASVSpoof 2015 corpus reveal several important findings. Firstly, all the countermeasures break down even at relatively high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and fail to generalize to noisy conditions. Secondly, speech enhancement is not found helpful. Thirdly, GMM back-end generally outperforms the more involved i-vector back-end. Fourthly, concerning the compared features, the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and subband spectral centroid magnitude coefficients (SCMCs) perform the best on average though the winner method depends on SNR and noise type. Finally, a study with two score fusion strategies shows that combining different feature based systems improves recognition accuracy for known and unknown attacks in both clean and noisy conditions.",cs
281,"Continuum Equilibria and Global Optimization for Routing in Dense Static
  Ad Hoc Networks","We consider massively dense ad hoc networks and study their continuum limits as the node density increases and as the graph providing the available routes becomes a continuous area with location and congestion dependent costs. We study both the global optimal solution as well as the non-cooperative routing problem among a large population of users where each user seeks a path from its origin to its destination so as to minimize its individual cost. Finally, we seek for a (continuum version of the) Wardrop equilibrium. We first show how to derive meaningful cost models as a function of the scaling properties of the capacity of the network and of the density of nodes. We present various solution methodologies for the problem: (1) the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, for the global optimization problem, (2) a method based on Green's Theorem for the least cost problem of an individual, and (3) a solution of the Wardrop equilibrium problem using a transformation into an equivalent global optimization problem.",cs
282,"Capacity Limits of Cognitive Radio with Distributed and Dynamic Spectral
  Activity","We investigate the capacity of opportunistic communication in the presence of dynamic and distributed spectral activity, i.e. when the time varying spectral holes sensed by the cognitive transmitter are correlated but not identical to those sensed by the cognitive receiver. Using the information theoretic framework of communication with causal and non-causal side information at the transmitter and/or the receiver, we obtain analytical capacity expressions and the corresponding numerical results. We find that cognitive radio communication is robust to dynamic spectral environments even when the communication occurs in bursts of only 3-5 symbols. The value of handshake overhead is investigated for both lightly loaded and heavily loaded systems. We find that the capacity benefits of overhead information flow from the transmitter to the receiver is negligible while feedback information overhead in the opposite direction significantly improves capacity.",cs
283,"An Input-Output Simulation Approach to Controlling Multi-AffineSystems
  for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications","This paper presents an input-output simulation approach to controlling multi-affine systems for linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications, which consists of the following steps. First, we partition the state space into rectangles, each of which satisfies atomic LTL propositions. Then, we study the control of multi-affine systems on rectangles including the control of driving all trajectories starting from a rectangle to exit through a facet and the control of stabilizing the system towards a desired point. With the proposed controllers, a finitely abstracted transition system is constructed which is shown to be input-output simulated by the rectangular transition system of the multi-affine system. Since input-output simulation preserves LTL properties, the controller synthesis of the multi-affine system for LTL specifications is achieved by designing a nonblocking supervisor for the abstracted transition system and by continuously implementing the resulting supervisor for the original multi-affine system.",cs
284,A Boundary Approximation Algorithm for Distributed Sensor Networks,"We present an algorithm for boundary approximation in locally-linked sensor networks that communicate with a remote monitoring station. Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi diagrams are used to generate a sensor communication network and define boundary segments between sensors, respectively. The proposed algorithm reduces remote station communication by approximating boundaries via a decentralized computation executed within the sensor network. Moreover, the algorithm identifies boundaries based on differences between neighboring sensor readings, and not absolute sensor values. An analysis of the bandwidth consumption of the algorithm is presented and compared to two naive approaches. The proposed algorithm reduces the amount of remote communication (compared to the naive approaches) and becomes increasingly useful in networks with more nodes.",cs
285,Handwritten digit Recognition using Support Vector Machine,"Handwritten Numeral recognition plays a vital role in postal automation services especially in countries like India where multiple languages and scripts are used Discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and hybrid of Neural Network (NN) and HMM are popular methods in handwritten word recognition system. The hybrid system gives better recognition result due to better discrimination capability of the NN. A major problem in handwriting recognition is the huge variability and distortions of patterns. Elastic models based on local observations and dynamic programming such HMM are not efficient to absorb this variability. But their vision is local. But they cannot face to length variability and they are very sensitive to distortions. Then the SVM is used to estimate global correlations and classify the pattern. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an alternative to NN. In Handwritten recognition, SVM gives a better recognition result. The aim of this paper is to develop an approach which improve the efficiency of handwritten recognition using artificial neural network",cs
286,"A Unified Framework for Tree Search Decoding : Rediscovering the
  Sequential Decoder","We consider receiver design for coded transmission over linear Gaussian channels. We restrict ourselves to the class of lattice codes and formulate the joint detection and decoding problem as a closest lattice point search (CLPS). Here, a tree search framework for solving the CLPS is adopted. In our framework, the CLPS algorithm decomposes into the preprocessing and tree search stages. The role of the preprocessing stage is to expose the tree structure in a form {\em matched} to the search stage. We argue that the minimum mean square error decision feedback (MMSE-DFE) frontend is instrumental for solving the joint detection and decoding problem in a single search stage. It is further shown that MMSE-DFE filtering allows for using lattice reduction methods to reduce complexity, at the expense of a marginal performance loss, and solving under-determined linear systems. For the search stage, we present a generic method, based on the branch and bound (BB) algorithm, and show that it encompasses all existing sphere decoders as special cases. The proposed generic algorithm further allows for an interesting classification of tree search decoders, sheds more light on the structural properties of all known sphere decoders, and inspires the design of more efficient decoders. In particular, an efficient decoding algorithm that resembles the well known Fano sequential decoder is identified. The excellent performance-complexity tradeoff achieved by the proposed MMSE-Fano decoder is established via simulation results and analytical arguments in several MIMO and ISI scenarios.",cs

289,Directional Dynamics along Arbitrary Curves in Cellular Automata,"This paper studies directional dynamics in cellular automata, a formalism previously introduced by the third author. The central idea is to study the dynamical behaviour of a cellular automaton through the conjoint action of its global rule (temporal action) and the shift map (spacial action): qualitative behaviours inherited from topological dynamics (equicontinuity, sensitivity, expansivity) are thus considered along arbitrary curves in space-time. The main contributions of the paper concern equicontinuous dynamics which can be connected to the notion of consequences of a word. We show that there is a cellular automaton with an equicontinuous dynamics along a parabola, but which is sensitive along any linear direction. We also show that real numbers that occur as the slope of a limit linear direction with equicontinuous dynamics in some cellular automaton are exactly the computably enumerable numbers.",cs

  Machines","We study the scheduling problem on unrelated machines in the mechanism design setting. This problem was proposed and studied in the seminal paper (Nisan and Ronen 1999), where they gave a 1.75-approximation randomized truthful mechanism for the case of two machines. We improve this result by a 1.6737-approximation randomized truthful mechanism. We also generalize our result to a $0.8368m$-approximation mechanism for task scheduling with $m$ machines, which improve the previous best upper bound of $0.875m(Mu'alem and Schapira 2007).",cs
292,Fast Vertex Guarding for Polygons,"For a polygon P with n vertices, the vertex guarding problem asks for the minimum subset G of P's vertices such that every point in P is seen by at least one point in G. This problem is NP-complete and APX-hard. The first approximation algorithm (Ghosh, 1987) involves decomposing P into O(n^4) cells that are equivalence classes for visibility from the vertices of P. This discretized problem can then be treated as an instance of set cover and solved in O(n^5) time with a greedy O(log n)-approximation algorithm. Ghosh (2010) recently revisited the algorithm, noting that minimum visibility decompositions for simple polygons (Bose et al., 2000) have only O(n^3) cells, improving the running time of the algorithm to O(n^4) for simple polygons.   In this paper we show that, since minimum visibility decompositions for simple polygons have only O(n^2) cells of minimal visibility (Bose et al., 2000), the running time of the algorithm can be further improved to O(n^3). This result was obtained independently by Jang and Kwon (2011). We extend the result of Bose et al. to polygons with holes, showing that a minimum visibility decomposition of a polygon with h holes has only O((h+1)n^3) cells and only O((h+1)^2 n^2) cells of minimal visibility. We exploit this result to obtain a faster algorithm for vertex guarding polygons with holes. We then show that, in the same time complexity, we can attain approximation factors of O(log log(opt)) for simple polygons and O((1+\log((h+1))) log(opt)) for polygons with holes.",cs
293,Optimal Deterministic Auctions with Correlated Priors,"We revisit the problem of designing the profit-maximizing single-item auction, solved by Myerson in his seminal paper for the case in which bidder valuations are independently distributed. We focus on general joint distributions, seeking the optimal deterministic incentive compatible auction. We give a geometric characterization of the optimal auction, resulting in a duality theorem and an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal deterministic auction in the two-bidder case and an NP-completeness result for three or more bidders.",cs
294,"Fault-tolerant control under controller-driven sampling using virtual
  actuator strategy","We present a new output feedback fault tolerant control strategy for continuous-time linear systems. The strategy combines a digital nominal controller under controller-driven (varying) sampling with virtual-actuator (VA)-based controller reconfiguration to compensate for actuator faults. In the proposed scheme, the controller controls both the plant and the sampling period, and performs controller reconfiguration by engaging in the loop the VA adapted to the diagnosed fault. The VA also operates under controller-driven sampling. Two independent objectives are considered: (a) closed-loop stability with setpoint tracking and (b) controller reconfiguration under faults. Our main contribution is to extend an existing VA-based controller reconfiguration strategy to systems under controller-driven sampling in such a way that if objective (a) is possible under controller-driven sampling (without VA) and objective (b) is possible under uniform sampling (without controller-driven sampling), then closed-loop stability and setpoint tracking will be preserved under both healthy and faulty operation for all possible sampling rate evolutions that may be selected by the controller.",cs
295,Multi-Faceted Ranking of News Articles using Post-Read Actions,"Personalized article recommendation is important to improve user engagement on news sites. Existing work quantifies engagement primarily through click rates. We argue that quality of recommendations can be improved by incorporating different types of ""post-read"" engagement signals like sharing, commenting, printing and e-mailing article links. More specifically, we propose a multi-faceted ranking problem for recommending news articles where each facet corresponds to a ranking problem to maximize actions of a post-read action type. The key technical challenge is to estimate the rates of post-read action types by mitigating the impact of enormous data sparsity, we do so through several variations of factor models. To exploit correlations among post-read action types we also introduce a novel variant called locally augmented tensor (LAT) model. Through data obtained from a major news site in the US, we show that factor models significantly outperform a few baseline IR models and the LAT model significantly outperforms several other variations of factor models. Our findings show that it is possible to incorporate post-read signals that are commonly available on online news sites to improve quality of recommendations.",cs
296,Memoryless Routing in Convex Subdivisions: Random Walks are Optimal,"A memoryless routing algorithm is one in which the decision about the next edge on the route to a vertex t for a packet currently located at vertex v is made based only on the coordinates of v, t, and the neighbourhood, N(v), of v. The current paper explores the limitations of such algorithms by showing that, for any (randomized) memoryless routing algorithm A, there exists a convex subdivision on which A takes Omega(n^2) expected time to route a message between some pair of vertices. Since this lower bound is matched by a random walk, this result implies that the geometric information available in convex subdivisions is not helpful for this class of routing algorithms. The current paper also shows the existence of triangulations for which the Random-Compass algorithm proposed by Bose etal (2002,2004) requires 2^{\Omega(n)} time to route between some pair of vertices.",cs

298,Constructing Optimal Highways,"For two points $p$ and $q$ in the plane, a straight line $h$, called a highway, and a real $v>1$, we define the \emph{travel time} (also known as the \emph{city distance}) from $p$ and $q$ to be the time needed to traverse a quickest path from $p$ to $q$, where the distance is measured with speed $v$ on $h$ and with speed 1 in the underlying metric elsewhere.   Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane and a highway speed $v$, we consider the problem of finding a \emph{highway} that minimizes the maximum travel time over all pairs of points in $S$. If the orientation of the highway is fixed, the optimal highway can be computed in linear time, both for the $L_1$- and the Euclidean metric as the underlying metric. If arbitrary orientations are allowed, then the optimal highway can be computed in $O(n^{2} \log n)$ time. We also consider the problem of computing an optimal pair of highways, one being horizontal, one vertical.",cs
299,Hysteresis effects of changing parameters of noncooperative games,"We adapt the method used by Jaynes to derive the equilibria of statistical physics to instead derive equilibria of bounded rational game theory. We analyze the dependence of these equilibria on the parameters of the underlying game, focusing on hysteresis effects. In particular, we show that by gradually imposing individual-specific tax rates on the players of the game, and then gradually removing those taxes, the players move from a poor equilibrium to one that is better for all of them.",cs
300,"Gaussian Channels with Feedback: Optimality, Fundamental Limitations,
  and Connections of Communication, Estimation, and Control","Gaussian channels with memory and with noiseless feedback have been widely studied in the information theory literature. However, a coding scheme to achieve the feedback capacity is not available. In this paper, a coding scheme is proposed to achieve the feedback capacity for Gaussian channels. The coding scheme essentially implements the celebrated Kalman filter algorithm, and is equivalent to an estimation system over the same channel without feedback. It reveals that the achievable information rate of the feedback communication system can be alternatively given by the decay rate of the Cramer-Rao bound of the associated estimation system. Thus, combined with the control theoretic characterizations of feedback communication (proposed by Elia), this implies that the fundamental limitations in feedback communication, estimation, and control coincide. This leads to a unifying perspective that integrates information, estimation, and control. We also establish the optimality of the Kalman filtering in the sense of information transmission, a supplement to the optimality of Kalman filtering in the sense of information processing proposed by Mitter and Newton. In addition, the proposed coding scheme generalizes the Schalkwijk-Kailath codes and reduces the coding complexity and coding delay. The construction of the coding scheme amounts to solving a finite-dimensional optimization problem. A simplification to the optimal stationary input distribution developed by Yang, Kavcic, and Tatikonda is also obtained. The results are verified in a numerical example.",cs
301,"Maximized Posteriori Attributes Selection from Facial Salient Landmarks
  for Face Recognition","This paper presents a robust and dynamic face recognition technique based on the extraction and matching of devised probabilistic graphs drawn on SIFT features related to independent face areas. The face matching strategy is based on matching individual salient facial graph characterized by SIFT features as connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth. In order to reduce the face matching errors, the Dempster-Shafer decision theory is applied to fuse the individual matching scores obtained from each pair of salient facial features. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the ORL and the IITK face databases. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed face recognition technique also in case of partially occluded faces.",cs
302,Staged Self-Assembly:Nanomanufacture of Arbitrary Shapes with O(1) Glues,"We introduce staged self-assembly of Wang tiles, where tiles can be added dynamically in sequence and where intermediate constructions can be stored for later mixing. This model and its various constraints and performance measures are motivated by a practical nanofabrication scenario through protein-based bioengineering. Staging allows us to break through the traditional lower bounds in tile self-assembly by encoding the shape in the staging algorithm instead of the tiles. All of our results are based on the practical assumption that only a constant number of glues, and thus only a constant number of tiles, can be engineered, as each new glue type requires significant biochemical research and experiments. Under this assumption, traditional tile self-assembly cannot even manufacture an n*n square; in contrast, we show how staged assembly enables manufacture of arbitrary orthogonal shapes in a variety of precise formulations of the model.",cs
303,Higher Order City Voronoi Diagrams,"We investigate higher-order Voronoi diagrams in the city metric. This metric is induced by quickest paths in the L1 metric in the presence of an accelerating transportation network of axis-parallel line segments. For the structural complexity of kth-order city Voronoi diagrams of n point sites, we show an upper bound of O(k(n - k) + kc) and a lower bound of {\Omega}(n + kc), where c is the complexity of the transportation network. This is quite different from the bound O(k(n - k)) in the Euclidean metric. For the special case where k = n - 1 the complexity in the Euclidean metric is O(n), while that in the city metric is {\Theta}(nc).   Furthermore, we develop an O(k^2(n + c) log n)-time iterative algorithm to compute the kth-order city Voronoi diagram and an O(nc log^2(n + c) log n)-time divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute the farthest-site city Voronoi diagram.",cs
304,Matching Entities Across Online Social Networks,"Online Social Networks (OSNs), such as Facebook and Twitter, have become an integral part of our daily lives. There are hundreds of OSNs, each with its own focus in that each offers particular services and functionalities. Recent studies show that many OSN users create several accounts on multiple OSNs using the same or different personal information. Collecting all the available data of an individual from several OSNs and fusing it into a single profile can be useful for many purposes. In this paper, we introduce novel machine learning based methods for solving Entity Resolution (ER), a problem for matching user profiles across multiple OSNs. The presented methods are able to match between two user profiles from two different OSNs based on supervised learning techniques, which use features extracted from each one of the user profiles. By using the extracted features and supervised learning techniques, we developed classifiers which can perform entity matching between two profiles for the following scenarios: (a) matching entities across two OSNs; (b) searching for a user by similar name; and (c) de-anonymizing a user's identity.   The constructed classifiers were tested by using data collected from two popular OSNs, Facebook and Xing. We then evaluated the classifiers' performances using various evaluation measures, such as true and false positive rates, accuracy, and the Area Under the receiver operator Curve (AUC). The constructed classifiers were evaluated and their classification performance measured by AUC was quite remarkable, with an AUC of up to 0.982 and an accuracy of up to 95.9% in identifying user profiles across two OSNs.",cs
305,Extremal Behaviour in Multiagent Contract Negotiation,"We examine properties of a model of resource allocation in which several agents exchange resources in order to optimise their individual holdings. The schemes discussed relate to well-known negotiation protocols proposed in earlier work and we consider a number of alternative notions of rationality covering both quantitative measures, e.g. cooperative and individual rationality and more qualitative forms, e.g. Pigou-Dalton transfers. While it is known that imposing particular rationality and structural restrictions may result in some reallocations of the resource set becoming unrealisable, in this paper we address the issue of the number of restricted rational deals that may be required to implement a particular reallocation when it is possible to do so. We construct examples showing that this number may be exponential (in the number of resources m), even when all of the agent utility functions are monotonic. We further show that k agents may achieve in a single deal a reallocation requiring exponentially many rational deals if at most k-1 agents can participate, this same reallocation being unrealisable by any sequences of rational deals in which at most k-2 agents are involved.",cs
306,Using the No-Search Easy-Hard Technique for Downward Collapse,"The top part of the preceding figure [figure appears in actual paper] shows some classes from the (truth-table) bounded-query and boolean hierarchies. It is well-known that if either of these hierarchies collapses at a given level, then all higher levels of that hierarchy collapse to that same level. This is a standard ``upward translation of equality'' that has been known for over a decade. The issue of whether these hierarchies can translate equality {\em downwards\/} has proven vastly more challenging. In particular, with regard to the figure above, consider the following claim:   $$P_{m-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} = P_{m+1-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} \implies   DIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) coDIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) = BH(\Sigma_k^p). (*) $$   This claim, if true, says that equality translates downwards between levels of the bounded-query hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy levels that (before the fact) are immediately below them.   Until recently, it was not known whether (*) {\em ever\/} held, except for the degenerate cases $m=0$ and $k=0$. Then Hemaspaandra, Hemaspaandra, and Hempel \cite{hem-hem-hem:j:downward-translation} proved that (*) holds for all $m$, for $k > 2$. Buhrman and Fortnow~\cite{buh-for:j:two-queries} then showed that, when $k=2$, (*) holds for the case $m = 1$. In this paper, we prove that for the case $k=2$, (*) holds for all values of $m$. Since there is an oracle relative to which ``for $k=1$, (*) holds for all $m$'' fails \cite{buh-for:j:two-queries}, our achievement of the $k=2$ case cannot to be strengthened to $k=1$ by any relativizable proof technique. The new downward translation we obtain also tightens the collapse in the polynomial hierarchy implied by a collapse in the bounded-query hierarchy of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.",cs
307,Fixed-parameter tractability and lower bounds for stabbing problems,"We study the following general stabbing problem from a parameterized complexity point of view: Given a set $\mathcal S$ of $n$ translates of an object in $\Rd$, find a set of $k$ lines with the property that every object in $\mathcal S$ is ''stabbed'' (intersected) by at least one line.   We show that when $S$ consists of axis-parallel unit squares in $\Rtwo$ the (decision) problem of stabbing $S$ with axis-parallel lines is W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ (and thus, not fixed-parameter tractable unless FPT=W[1]) while it becomes fixed-parameter tractable when the squares are disjoint. We also show that the problem of stabbing a set of disjoint unit squares in $\Rtwo$ with lines of arbitrary directions is W[1]--hard with respect to $k$. Several generalizations to other types of objects and lines with arbitrary directions are also presented. Finally, we show that deciding whether a set of unit balls in $\Rd$ can be stabbed by one line is W[1]--hard with respect to the dimension $d$.",cs
308,The Cerny Conjecture,"The \v{C}ern\'y conjecture (\v{C}ern\'y, 1964) states that each n-state \san\ possess a \sw\ of length $(n-1)^2$. From the other side the best upper bound for the \rl\ of n-state \sa\ known so far is equal to $\frac{n^3-n}6$ (Pin, 1983) and so is cubic (a slightly better though still cubic upper bound $\frac{n(7n^2+6n-16)}{48}$ has been claimed in Trahtman but the published proof of this result contains an unclear place) in $n$. In the paper the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture is reduced to a simpler conjecture. In particular, we prove \v{C}ern\'y conjecture for one-cluster automata and quadratic upper bounds for automata closed to one-cluster automata. Our approach utilize theory of Markov chains and one simple fact from linear programming.",cs
309,"Phase reconstruction of spectrograms based on a model of repeated audio
  events","Phase recovery of modified spectrograms is a major issue in audio signal processing applications, such as source separation. This paper introduces a novel technique for estimating the phases of components in complex mixtures within onset frames in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose to exploit the phase repetitions from one onset frame to another. We introduce a reference phase which characterizes a component independently of its activation times. The onset phases of a component are then modeled as the sum of this reference and an offset which is linearly dependent on the frequency. We derive a complex mixture model within onset frames and we provide two algorithms for the estimation of the model phase parameters. The model is estimated on experimental data and this technique is integrated into an audio source separation framework. The results demonstrate that this model is a promising tool for exploiting phase repetitions, and point out its potential for separating overlapping components in complex mixtures.",cs

  Extension Field","A new efficient algorithm is proposed for factoring polynomials over an algebraic extension field. The extension field is defined by a polynomial ring modulo a maximal ideal. If the maximal ideal is given by its Groebner basis, no extra Groebner basis computation is needed for factoring a polynomial over this extension field. Nothing more than linear algebraic technique is used to get a polynomial over the ground field by a generic linear map. Then this polynomial is factorized over the ground field. From these factors, the factorization of the polynomial over the extension field is obtained. The new algorithm has been implemented and computer experiments indicate that the new algorithm is very efficient, particularly in complicated examples.",cs

In this article we summarize that work and describe the software development process more formally by presenting the tools we use in this process in a CASE setting, leading to the PSF-ToolBus software engineering environment. We generalize the refine step in this environment towards a process algebra based software engineering workbench of which several instances can be combined to form an environment.",cs
313,"Using Cache-coloring to Mitigate Inter-set Write Variation in
  Non-volatile Caches","In recent years, researchers have explored use of non-volatile devices such as STT-RAM (spin torque transfer RAM) for designing on-chip caches, since they provide high density and consume low leakage power. A common limitation of all non-volatile devices is their limited write endurance. Further, since existing cache management policies are write-variation unaware, excessive writes to a few blocks may lead to a quick failure of the whole cache. We propose an architectural technique for wear-leveling of non-volatile last level caches (LLCs). Our technique uses cache-coloring approach which adds a software-controlled mapping layer between groups of physical pages and cache sets. Periodically the mapping is altered to ensure that write-traffic can be spread uniformly to different sets of the cache to achieve wear-leveling. Simulations performed with an x86-64 simulator and SPEC2006 benchmarks show that our technique reduces the worst-case writes to cache blocks and thus improves the cache lifetime by 4.07X.",cs
314,"Cost-minimising strategies for data labelling : optimal stopping and
  active learning","Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy, while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a) optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related field of active learning.",cs
315,The anatomy of Reddit: An overview of academic research,"Online forums provide rich environments where users may post questions and comments about different topics. Understanding how people behave in online forums may shed light on the fundamental mechanisms by which collective thinking emerges in a group of individuals, but it has also important practical applications, for instance to improve user experience, increase engagement or automatically identify bullying. Importantly, the datasets generated by the activity of the users are often openly available for researchers, in contrast to other sources of data in computational social science. In this survey, we map the main research directions that arose in recent years and focus primarily on the most popular platform, Reddit. We distinguish and categorise research depending on their focus on the posts or on the users, and point to different types of methodologies to extract information from the structure and dynamics of the system. We emphasize the diversity and richness of the research in terms of questions and methods, and suggest future avenues of research.",cs
316,"The L-CSC cluster: greenest supercomputer in the world in Green500 list
  of November 2014","The L-CSC (Lattice Computer for Scientific Computing) is a general purpose compute cluster built of commodity hardware installed at GSI. Its main operational purpose is Lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations for physics simulations. Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) is the physical theory describing the strong force, one of the four known fundamental interactions in the universe. L-CSC leverages a multi-GPU design accommodating the huge demand of LQCD for memory bandwidth. In recent years, heterogeneous clusters with accelerators such as GPUs have become more and more powerful while supercomputers in general have shown enormous increases in power consumption making electricity costs and cooling a significant factor in the total cost of ownership. Using mainly GPUs for processing, L-CSC is very power efficient, and its architecture was optimized to provide the greatest possible power efficiency. This paper presents the cluster design as well as optimizations to improve the power efficiency. It examines the power measurements performed for the Green500 list of the most power efficient supercomputers in the world which led to the number 1 position as the greenest supercomputer in November 2014.",cs
317,End-to-end Source Separation with Adaptive Front-Ends,"Source separation and other audio applications have traditionally relied on the use of short-time Fourier transforms as a front-end frequency domain representation step. The unavailability of a neural network equivalent to forward and inverse transforms hinders the implementation of end-to-end learning systems for these applications. We present an auto-encoder neural network that can act as an equivalent to short-time front-end transforms. We demonstrate the ability of the network to learn optimal, real-valued basis functions directly from the raw waveform of a signal and further show how it can be used as an adaptive front-end for supervised source separation. In terms of separation performance, these transforms significantly outperform their Fourier counterparts. Finally, we also propose a novel source to distortion ratio based cost function for end-to-end source separation.",cs

The AGM revisions that satisfy this new postulate stand in one-to-one correspondence with the rational, consistency-preserving relations. This correspondence is described explicitly. Two viewpoints on iterative revisions are distinguished and discussed.",cs
319,"A New Continuous-Time Equality-Constrained Optimization Method to Avoid
  Singularity","In equality-constrained optimization, a standard regularity assumption is often associated with feasible point methods, namely the gradients of constraints are linearly independent. In practice, the regularity assumption may be violated. To avoid such a singularity, we propose a new projection matrix, based on which a feasible point method for the continuous-time, equality-constrained optimization problem is developed. First, the equality constraint is transformed into a continuous-time dynamical system with solutions that always satisfy the equality constraint. Then, the singularity is explained in detail and a new projection matrix is proposed to avoid singularity. An update (or say a controller) is subsequently designed to decrease the objective function along the solutions of the transformed system. The invariance principle is applied to analyze the behavior of the solution. We also propose a modified approach for addressing cases in which solutions do not satisfy the equality constraint. Finally, the proposed optimization approaches are applied to two examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.",cs

321,"Building A High Performance Parallel File System Using Grid Datafarm and
  ROOT I/O","Sheer amount of petabyte scale data foreseen in the LHC experiments require a careful consideration of the persistency design and the system design in the world-wide distributed computing. Event parallelism of the HENP data analysis enables us to take maximum advantage of the high performance cluster computing and networking when we keep the parallelism both in the data processing phase, in the data management phase, and in the data transfer phase. A modular architecture of FADS/ Goofy, a versatile detector simulation framework for Geant4, enables an easy choice of plug-in facilities for persistency technologies such as Objectivity/DB and ROOT I/O. The framework is designed to work naturally with the parallel file system of Grid Datafarm (Gfarm). FADS/Goofy is proven to generate 10^6 Geant4-simulated Atlas Mockup events using a 512 CPU PC cluster. The data in ROOT I/O files is replicated using Gfarm file system. The histogram information is collected from the distributed ROOT files. During the data replication it has been demonstrated to achieve more than 2.3 Gbps data transfer rate between the PC clusters over seven participating PC clusters in the United States and in Japan.",cs
322,"Une méthode pour caractériser les communautés des réseaux
  dynamiques à attributs","Many complex systems are modeled through complex networks whose analysis reveals typical topological properties. Amongst those, the community structure is one of the most studied. Many methods are proposed to detect communities, not only in plain, but also in attributed, directed or even dynamic networks. A community structure takes the form of a partition of the node set, which must then be characterized relatively to the properties of the studied system. We propose a method to support such a characterization task. We define a sequence-based representation of networks, combining temporal information, topological measures, and nodal attributes. We then characterize communities using the most representative emerging sequential patterns of its nodes. This also allows detecting unusual behavior in a community. We describe an empirical study of a network of scientific collaborations.---De nombreux syst\`emes complexes sont \'etudi\'es via l'analyse de r\'eseaux dits complexes ayant des propri\'et\'es topologiques typiques.

323,Spin Wave Neuroanalog of von Neumann's Microwave Computer,"Frequency and phase of neural activity play important roles in the behaving brain. The emerging understanding of these roles has been informed by the design of analog devices that have been important to neuroscience, among them the neuroanalog computer developed by O. Schmitt in the 1930's. In the 1950's, J. von Neumann, in a search for high performance computing using microwaves, invented a logic machine based on similar devices, that can perform logic functions including binary arithmetic. Described here is a novel embodiment of his machine using nano-magnetics. The embodiment is based on properties of ferromagnetic thin films that are governed by a nonlinear Schrodinger equation for magnetization in a film. Electrical currents through point contacts on a film create spin torque nano oscillators (STNO) that define the oscillator elements of the system. These oscillators may communicate through directed graphs of electrical connections or by radiation in the form of spin waves. It is shown here how to construct a logic machine using STNO, that this machine can perform several computations simultaneously using multiplexing of inputs, that this system can evaluate iterated logic functions, and that spin waves can communicate frequency, phase and binary information. Neural tissue and the Schmitt, von Neumann and STNO devices share a common bifurcation structure, although these systems operate on vastly different space and time scales. This suggests that neural circuits may be capable of computational functionality described here.",cs
324,"On the $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear relations of Mersenne Twister pseudorandom
  number generators","Sequence generators obtained by linear recursions over the two-element field $\mathbb{F}_2$, i.e., $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear generators, are widely used as pseudorandom number generators. For example, the Mersenne Twister MT19937 is one of the most successful applications. An advantage of such generators is that we can assess them quickly by using theoretical criteria, such as the dimension of equidistribution with $v$-bit accuracy. To compute these dimensions, several polynomial-time lattice reduction algorithms have been proposed in the case of $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear generators.   In this paper, in order to assess non-random bit patterns in dimensions that are higher than the dimension of equidistribution with $v$-bit accuracy,we focus on the relationship between points in the Couture--L'Ecuyer dual lattices and $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear relations on the most significant $v$ bits of output sequences, and consider a new figure of merit $N_v$ based on the minimum weight of $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear relations whose degrees are minimal for $v$. Next, we numerically show that MT19937 has low-weight $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear relations in dimensions higher than 623, and show that some output vectors with specific lags are rejected or have small $p$-values in the birthday spacings tests. We also report that some variants of Mersenne Twister, such as WELL generators, are significantly improved from the perspective of $N_v$.",cs
325,Jigsaw-based Security in Data Transfer in Computer Networks,"In this paper, we present a novel encryption-less algorithm to enhance security in transmission of data in networks. The algorithm uses an intuitively simple idea of a 'jigsaw puzzle' to break the transformed data into multiple parts where these parts form the pieces of the puzzle. Then these parts are packaged into packets and sent to the receiver. A secure and efficient mechanism is provided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining the original data at the receiver-end from its parts in the packets, that is, for solving the 'jigsaw puzzle'. The algorithm is designed to provide information-theoretic (that is, unconditional) security by the use of a one-time pad like scheme so that no intermediate or unintended node can obtain the entire data. An authentication code is also used to ensure authenticity of every packet.",cs

If such a colouring exists, our algorithm produces it.",cs

328,"Random polynomials and expected complexity of bisection methods for real
  solving","Our probabilistic analysis sheds light to the following questions: Why do random polynomials seem to have few, and well separated real roots, on the average? Why do exact algorithms for real root isolation may perform comparatively well or even better than numerical ones? We exploit results by Kac, and by Edelman and Kostlan in order to estimate the real root separation of degree $d$ polynomials with i.i.d.\ coefficients that follow two zero-mean normal distributions: for SO(2) polynomials, the $i$-th coefficient has variance ${d \choose i}$, whereas for Weyl polynomials its variance is ${1/i!}$. By applying results from statistical physics, we obtain the expected (bit) complexity of \func{sturm} solver, $\sOB(r d^2 \tau)$, where $r$ is the number of real roots and $\tau$ the maximum coefficient bitsize. Our bounds are two orders of magnitude tighter than the record worst case ones. We also derive an output-sensitive bound in the worst case. The second part of the paper shows that the expected number of real roots of a degree $d$ polynomial in the Bernstein basis is $\sqrt{2d}\pm\OO(1)$, when the coefficients are i.i.d.\ variables with moderate standard deviation. Our paper concludes with experimental results which corroborate our analysis.",cs

330,Memory Capacity of a Random Neural Network,This paper considers the problem of information capacity of a random neural network. The network is represented by matrices that are square and symmetrical. The matrices have a weight which determines the highest and lowest possible value found in the matrix.

We find the surprising result that the capacity of the network is a maximum for the binary random neural network and it does not change as the number of quantization levels associated with the weights increases.,cs
331,"Spectral Statistics of Lattice Graph Structured, Non-uniform
  Percolations","Design of filters for graph signal processing benefits from knowledge of the spectral decomposition of matrices that encode graphs, such as the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian matrix, used to define the shift operator. For shift matrices with real eigenvalues, which arise for symmetric graphs, the empirical spectral distribution captures the eigenvalue locations. Under realistic circumstances, stochastic influences often affect the network structure and, consequently, the shift matrix empirical spectral distribution. Nevertheless, deterministic functions may often be found to approximate the asymptotic behavior of empirical spectral distributions of random matrices. This paper uses stochastic canonical equation methods developed by Girko to derive such deterministic equivalent distributions for the empirical spectral distributions of random graphs formed by structured, non-uniform percolation of a D-dimensional lattice supergraph. Included simulations demonstrate the results for sample parameters.",cs
332,Differentiable Scripting,"In Computational Science, Engineering and Finance (CSEF) scripts typically serve as the ""glue"" between potentially highly complex and computationally expensive external subprograms. Differentiability of the resulting programs turns out to be essential in the context of derivative-based methods for error analysis, uncertainty quantification, optimization or training of surrogates. We argue that it should be enforced by the scripting language itself through exclusive support of differentiable (smoothed) external subprograms and differentiable intrinsics combined with prohibition of nondifferentiable branches in the data flow. Illustration is provided by a prototype adjoint code compiler for a simple Python-like scripting language.",cs
333,T-Learning,"Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) has focused on problems involving many states and few actions, such as simple grid worlds. Most real world problems, however, are of the opposite type, Involving Few relevant states and many actions. For example, to return home from a conference, humans identify only few subgoal states such as lobby, taxi, airport etc. Each valid behavior connecting two such states can be viewed as an action, and there are trillions of them. Assuming the subgoal identification problem is already solved, the quality of any RL method---in real-world settings---depends less on how well it scales with the number of states than on how well it scales with the number of actions. This is where our new method T-Learning excels, by evaluating the relatively few possible transits from one state to another in a policy-independent way, rather than a huge number of state-action pairs, or states in traditional policy-dependent ways. Illustrative experiments demonstrate that performance improvements of T-Learning over Q-learning can be arbitrarily large.",cs

  Accelerator","On-device intelligence is gaining significant attention recently as it offers local data processing and low power consumption. In this research, an on-device training circuitry for threshold-current memristors integrated in a crossbar structure is proposed. Furthermore, alternate approaches of mapping the synaptic weights into fully-trained and semi-trained crossbars are investigated. In a semi-trained crossbar a confined subset of memristors are tuned and the remaining subset of memristors are not programmed. This translates to optimal resource utilization and power consumption, compared to a fully programmed crossbar. The semi-trained crossbar architecture is applicable to a broad class of neural networks. System level verification is performed with an extreme learning machine for binomial and multinomial classification. The total power for a single 4x4 layer network, when implemented in IBM 65nm node, is estimated to be ~ 42.16uW and the area is estimated to be 26.48um x 22.35um.",cs

339,"BOPS, Not FLOPS! A New Metric and Roofline Performance Model For
  Datacenter Computing","For emerging datacenter (in short, DC) workloads, such as online Internet services or offline data analytics, how to evaluate the upper bound performance and provide apple-to-apple comparisons are fundamental problems. To this end, a unified computation-centric metric is an essential requirement. As the most important computation-centric performance metric, FLOPS has guided computing systems evolutions for many years. However, our observations demonstrate that the average FLOPS efficiency of the DC workloads is only 0.1%, which implies that FLOPS is inappropriate for DC computing. To address the above issue, we propose BOPS (Basic Operations Per Second), which is the average number of BOPs (Basic OPerations) completed per second. We conduct the analysis on the characteristics of seventeen typical DC workloads and extract the minimum representative computation operations set, which is composed of integer and floating point computation operations of arithmetic, comparing and array addressing. Then, we propose the formalized BOPS definition and the BOPS based upper bound performance model. Finally, the BOPS measuring tool is also implemented. We perform experiments with seventeen DC workloads on three typical Intel processors platforms. First, BOPS can reflect the performance gap of different computing systems, the bias between the peak BOPS performance gap and the average DC workloads' wall clock time gap is no more than 10%. Second, the Sort workload can achieve 32% BOPS efficiency on the experimental platform. At last, we present two use cases of BOPS. One is the BOPS based system evaluation, we illustrate that BOPS can compare performance of workloads from multiple domains. The other is BOPS based optimizations. We show that under the guiding of the BOPS based upper bound model, the Sort workload and the Redis workload achieve 4.4X and 1.2X performance improvements respectively.",cs

In the case of 90-degree angles, we establish a lower bound of 2 and an upper bound of 7. In the case of 180-degree angles, we establish a lower bound of sqrt(3) and an upper bound of 1+sqrt(3).

Starting on the core level and going down the memory hierarchy we cover instruction throughput for floating-point instructions, L1 cache, address generation capabilities, core clock speed and its limitations, L2 and L3 cache bandwidth and latency, the impact of Cluster on Die (CoD) and cache snoop modes, and the Uncore clock speed. Using microbenchmarks we study the influence of these factors on code performance. This insight can then serve as input for analytic performance models. We show that the energy efficiency of the LINPACK and HPCG benchmarks can be improved considerably by tuning the Uncore clock speed without sacrificing performance, and that the Graph500 benchmark performance may profit from a suitable choice of cache snoop mode settings.",cs
343,Optimization and Evaluation of Nested Queries and Procedures,"Many database applications perform complex data retrieval and update tasks. Nested queries, and queries that invoke user-defined functions, which are written using a mix of procedural and SQL constructs, are often used in such applications. A straight-forward evaluation of such queries involves repeated execution of parameterized sub-queries or blocks containing queries and procedural code.   An important problem that arises while optimizing nested queries as well as queries with joins, aggregates and set operations is the problem of finding an optimal sort order from a factorial number of possible sort orders. We show that even a special case of this problem is NP-Hard, and present practical heuristics that are effective and easy to incorporate in existing query optimizers.   We also consider iterative execution of queries and updates inside complex procedural blocks such as user-defined functions and stored procedures. Parameter batching is an important means of improving performance as it enables set-orientated processing. The key challenge to parameter batching lies in rewriting a given procedure/function to process a batch of parameter values. We propose a solution, based on program analysis and rewrite rules, to automate the generation of batched forms of procedures and replace iterative database calls within imperative loops with a single call to the batched form.   We present experimental results for the proposed techniques, and the results show significant gains in performance.",cs

345,Inter-Package Dependency Networks in Open-Source Software,"This research analyzes complex networks in open-source software at the inter-package level, where package dependencies often span across projects and between development groups. We review complex networks identified at ``lower'' levels of abstraction, and then formulate a description of interacting software components at the package level, a relatively ``high'' level of abstraction. By mining open-source software repositories from two sources, we empirically show that the coupling of modules at this granularity creates a small-world and scale-free network in both instances.",cs

347,Robust Recursive State Estimation with Random Measurements Droppings,"A recursive state estimation procedure is derived for a linear time varying system with both parametric uncertainties and stochastic measurement droppings. This estimator has a similar form as that of the Kalman filter with intermittent observations, but its parameters should be adjusted when a plant output measurement arrives. A new recursive form is derived for the pseudo-covariance matrix of estimation errors, which plays important roles in analyzing its asymptotic properties. Based on a Riemannian metric for positive definite matrices, some necessary and sufficient conditions have been obtained for the strict contractiveness of an iteration of this recursion. It has also been proved that under some controllability and observability conditions, as well as some weak requirements on measurement arrival probability, the gain matrix of this recursive robust state estimator converges in probability one to a stationary distribution. Numerical simulation results show that estimation accuracy of the suggested procedure is more robust against parametric modelling errors than the Kalman filter.",cs
348,"Design of Multistage Decimation Filters Using Cyclotomic Polynomials:
  Optimization and Design Issues","This paper focuses on the design of multiplier-less decimation filters suitable for oversampled digital signals. The aim is twofold. On one hand, it proposes an optimization framework for the design of constituent decimation filters in a general multistage decimation architecture. The basic building blocks embedded in the proposed filters belong, for a simple reason, to the class of cyclotomic polynomials (CPs): the first 104 CPs have a z-transfer function whose coefficients are simply {-1,0,+1}. On the other hand, the paper provides a bunch of useful techniques, most of which stemming from some key properties of CPs, for designing the proposed filters in a variety of architectures. Both recursive and non-recursive architectures are discussed by focusing on a specific decimation filter obtained as a result of the optimization algorithm.   Design guidelines are provided with the aim to simplify the design of the constituent decimation filters in the multistage chain.",cs
349,"Towards the Framework of the File Systems Performance Evaluation
  Techniques and the Taxonomy of Replay Traces","This is the era of High Performance Computing (HPC). There is a great demand of the best performance evaluation techniques for the file and storage systems. The task of evaluation is both necessary and hard. It gives in depth analysis of the target system and that becomes the decision points for the users. That is also helpful for the inventors or developers to find out the bottleneck in their systems. In this paper many performance evaluation techniques are described for file and storage system evaluation and the main stress is given on the important one that is replay traces. A survey has been done for the performance evaluation techniques used by the researchers and on the replay traces. And the taxonomy of the replay traces is described. The some of the popular replay traces are just like, Tracefs [1], //Trace [2], Replayfs [3] and VFS Interceptor [12]. At last we have concluded all the features that must be considered when we are going to develop the new tool for the replay traces. The complete work of this paper shows that the storage system developers must care about all the techniques which can be used for the performance evaluation of the file systems. So they can develop highly efficient future file and storage systems.",cs
350,"A decision support system for ship identification based on the curvature
  scale space representation","In this paper, a decision support system for ship identification is presented. The system receives as input a silhouette of the vessel to be identified, previously extracted from a side view of the object. This view could have been acquired with imaging sensors operating at different spectral ranges (CCD, FLIR, image intensifier). The input silhouette is preprocessed and compared to those stored in a database, retrieving a small number of potential matches ranked by their similarity to the target silhouette. This set of potential matches is presented to the system operator, who makes the final ship identification. This system makes use of an evolved version of the Curvature Scale Space (CSS) representation. In the proposed approach, it is curvature extrema, instead of zero crossings, that are tracked during silhouette evolution, hence improving robustness and enabling to cope successfully with cases where the standard CCS representation is found to be unstable. Also, the use of local curvature was replaced with the more robust concept of lobe concavity, with significant additional gains in performance. Experimental results on actual operational imagery prove the excellent performance and robustness of the developed method.",cs
351,Separations of non-monotonic randomness notions,"In the theory of algorithmic randomness, several notions of random sequence are defined via a game-theoretic approach, and the notions that received most attention are perhaps Martin-Loef randomness and computable randomness. The latter notion was introduced by Schnorr and is rather natural: an infinite binary sequence is computably random if no total computable strategy succeeds on it by betting on bits in order. However, computably random sequences can have properties that one may consider to be incompatible with being random, in particular, there are computably random sequences that are highly compressible. The concept of Martin-Loef randomness is much better behaved in this and other respects, on the other hand its definition in terms of martingales is considerably less natural. Muchnik, elaborating on ideas of Kolmogorov and Loveland, refined Schnorr's model by also allowing non-monotonic strategies, i.e. strategies that do not bet on bits in order. The subsequent ``non-monotonic'' notion of randomness, now called Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness, has been shown to be quite close to Martin-Loef randomness, but whether these two classes coincide remains a fundamental open question. As suggested by Miller and Nies, we study in this paper weak versions of Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness, where the betting strategies are non-adaptive (i.e., the positions of the bits to bet on should be decided before the game). We obtain a full classification of the different notions we consider.",cs
352,Pricing Options on Defaultable Stocks,"In this note, we develop stock option price approximations for a model which takes both the risk o default and the stochastic volatility into account. We also let the intensity of defaults be influenced by the volatility. We show that it might be possible to infer the risk neutral default intensity from the stock option prices. Our option price approximation has a rich implied volatility surface structure and fits the data implied volatility well. Our calibration exercise shows that an effective hazard rate from bonds issued by a company can be used to explain the implied volatility skew of the implied volatility of the option prices issued by the same company.",cs
353,"Improving Generalization Ability of Genetic Programming: Comparative
  Study","In the field of empirical modeling using Genetic Programming (GP), it is important to evolve solution with good generalization ability. Generalization ability of GP solutions get affected by two important issues: bloat and over-fitting. Bloat is uncontrolled growth of code without any gain in fitness and important issue in GP. We surveyed and classified existing literature related to different techniques used by GP research community to deal with the issue of bloat. Moreover, the classifications of different bloat control approaches and measures for bloat are discussed. Next, we tested four bloat control methods: Tarpeian, double tournament, lexicographic parsimony pressure with direct bucketing and ratio bucketing on six different problems and identified where each bloat control method performs well on per problem basis. Based on the analysis of each method, we combined two methods: double tournament (selection method) and Tarpeian method (works before evaluation) to avoid bloated solutions and compared with the results obtained from individual performance of double tournament method. It was found that the results were improved with this combination of two methods.",cs
354,Entity Based Peer-to-Peer in a Data Grid Environment,"During the last decade there has been a huge interest in Grid technologies, and numerous Grid projects have been initiated with various visions of the Grid. While all these visions have the same goal of resource sharing, they differ in the functionality that a Grid supports, the grid characterisation, programming environments, etc. In this paper we present a new Grid system dedicated to deal with data issues, called DGET (Data Grid Environment and Tools). DGET is characterized by its peer-to-peer communication system and entity-based architecture, therefore, taking advantage of the main functionality of both systems; P2P and Grid. DGET is currently under development and a prototype implementing the main components is in its first phase of testing. In this paper we limit our description to the system architectural features and to the main differences with other systems.",cs

  Algorithms","We consider the problem of warehouse multi-robot automation system in discrete-time and discrete-space configuration with focus on the task allocation and conflict-free path planning. We present a system design where a centralized server handles the task allocation and each robot performs local path planning distributively. A genetic-based task allocation algorithm is firstly presented, with modification to enable heuristic learning. A semi-complete potential field based local path planning algorithm is then proposed, named the recursive excitation/relaxation artificial potential field (RERAPF). A mathematical proof is also presented to show the semi-completeness of the RERAPF algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is the modification of conventional artificial potential field (APF) to be semi-complete while computationally efficient, resolving the traditional issue of incompleteness. Simulation results are also presented for performance evaluation of the proposed path planning algorithm and the overall system.",cs
357,The Role of Schema Matching in Large Enterprises,"To date, the principal use case for schema matching research has been as a precursor for code generation, i.e., constructing mappings between schema elements with the end goal of data transfer. In this paper, we argue that schema matching plays valuable roles independent of mapping construction, especially as schemata grow to industrial scales. Specifically, in large enterprises human decision makers and planners are often the immediate consumer of information derived from schema matchers, instead of schema mapping tools. We list a set of real application areas illustrating this role for schema matching, and then present our experiences tackling a customer problem in one of these areas. We describe the matcher used, where the tool was effective, where it fell short, and our lessons learned about how well current schema matching technology is suited for use in large enterprises. Finally, we suggest a new agenda for schema matching research based on these experiences.",cs

360,"Pattern Matching and Discourse Processing in Information Extraction from
  Japanese Text","Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance.",cs
361,Inductive-data-type Systems,"In a previous work (""Abstract Data Type Systems"", TCS 173(2), 1997), the last two authors presented a combined language made of a (strongly normalizing) algebraic rewrite system and a typed lambda-calculus enriched by pattern-matching definitions following a certain format, called the ""General Schema"", which generalizes the usual recursor definitions for natural numbers and similar ""basic inductive types"". This combined language was shown to be strongly normalizing. The purpose of this paper is to reformulate and extend the General Schema in order to make it easily extensible, to capture a more general class of inductive types, called ""strictly positive"", and to ease the strong normalization proof of the resulting system. This result provides a computation model for the combination of an algebraic specification language based on abstract data types and of a strongly typed functional language with strictly positive inductive types.",cs

  version --","Gossip protocols form the basis of many smart collective adaptive systems. They are a class of fully decentralised, simple but robust protocols for the distribution of information throughout large scale networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes. Mean field analysis methods have made it possible to approximate and analyse performance aspects of such large scale protocols in an efficient way. Taking the gossip shuffle protocol as a benchmark, we evaluate a recently developed refined mean field approach. We illustrate the gain in accuracy this can provide for the analysis of medium size models analysing two key performance measures. We also show that refined mean field analysis requires special attention to correctly capture the coordination aspects of the gossip shuffle protocol.",cs

  withTime-Frequency Domain Features","A mixed sample data augmentation strategy is proposed to enhance the performance of models on audio scene classification, sound event classification, and speech enhancement tasks. While there have been several augmentation methods shown to be effective in improving image classification performance, their efficacy toward time-frequency domain features of audio is not assured. We propose a novel audio data augmentation approach named ""Specmix"" specifically designed for dealing with time-frequency domain features. The augmentation method consists of mixing two different data samples by applying time-frequency masks effective in preserving the spectral correlation of each audio sample. Our experiments on acoustic scene classification, sound event classification, and speech enhancement tasks show that the proposed Specmix improves the performance of various neural network architectures by a maximum of 2.7%.",cs

  faculty for the next generation of research impact metrics","As scholars migrate into online spaces like Mendeley, blogs, Twitter, and more, they leave new traces of once-invisible interactions like reading, saving, discussing, and recommending. Observing these traces can inform new metrics of scholarly influence and impact -- so-called ""altmetrics."" Stakeholders in academia are beginning to discuss how and where altmetrics can be useful towards evaluating a researcher's academic contribution. As this interest grows, libraries are in a unique position to help support an informed dialog on campus. We suggest that librarians can provide this support in three main ways: informing emerging conversations with the latest research, supporting experimentation with emerging altmetrics tools, and engaging in early altmetrics education and outreach. We include examples and lists of resources to help librarians fill these roles.",cs

367,"A Fast Implementation of Singular Value Thresholding Algorithm using
  Recycling Rank Revealing Randomized Singular Value Decomposition","In this paper, we present a fast implementation of the Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) algorithm for matrix completion. A rank-revealing randomized singular value decomposition (R3SVD) algorithm is used to adaptively carry out partial singular value decomposition (SVD) to fast approximate the SVT operator given a desired, fixed precision. We extend the R3SVD algorithm to a recycling rank revealing randomized singular value decomposition (R4SVD) algorithm by reusing the left singular vectors obtained from the previous iteration as the approximate basis in the current iteration, where the computational cost for partial SVD at each SVT iteration is significantly reduced. A simulated annealing style cooling mechanism is employed to adaptively adjust the low-rank approximation precision threshold as SVT progresses. Our fast SVT implementation is effective in both large and small matrices, which is demonstrated in matrix completion applications including image recovery and movie recommendation system.",cs
368,"Application of Global and One-Dimensional Local Optimization to
  Operating System Scheduler Tuning","This paper describes a study of comparison of global and one-dimensional local optimization methods to operating system scheduler tuning. The operating system scheduler we use is the Linux 2.6.23 Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) running in simulator (LinSched). We have ported the Hackbench scheduler benchmark to this simulator and use this as the workload. The global optimization approach we use is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We make use of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to specify optimal parameters for our PSO implementation. The one-dimensional local optimization approach we use is the Golden Section method. In order to use this approach, we convert the scheduler tuning problem from one involving setting of three parameters to one involving the manipulation of one parameter. Our results show that the global optimization approach yields better response but the one- dimensional optimization approach converges to a solution faster than the global optimization approach.",cs
369,"Evaluation of interval extension of the power function by graph
  decomposition","The subject of our talk is the correct evaluation of interval extension of the function specified by the expression x^y without any constraints on the values of x and y. The core of our approach is a decomposition of the graph of x^y into a small number of parts which can be transformed into subsets of the graph of x^y for non-negative bases x. Because of this fact, evaluation of interval extension of x^y, without any constraints on x and y, is not much harder than evaluation of interval extension of x^y for non-negative bases x.",cs
370,Economy-based Content Replication for Peering Content Delivery Networks,"Existing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) exhibit the nature of closed delivery networks which do not cooperate with other CDNs and in practice, islands of CDNs are formed. The logical separation between contents and services in this context results in two content networking domains. In addition to that, meeting the Quality of Service requirements of users according to negotiated Service Level Agreement is crucial for a CDN. Present trends in content networks and content networking capabilities give rise to the interest in interconnecting content networks. Hence, in this paper, we present an open, scalable, and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based system that assist the creation of open Content and Service Delivery Networks (CSDNs), which scale and supports sharing of resources through peering with other CSDNs. To encourage resource sharing and peering arrangements between different CDN providers at global level, we propose using market-based models by introducing an economy-based strategy for content replication.",cs
371,"Optimized Fuzzy Logic Based Framework for Effort Estimation in Software
  Development","Software effort estimation at early stages of project development holds great significance for the industry to meet the competitive demands of today's world. Accuracy, reliability and precision in the estimates of effort are quite desirable. The inherent imprecision present in the inputs of the algorithmic models like Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) yields imprecision in the output, resulting in erroneous effort estimation. Fuzzy logic based cost estimation models are inherently suitable to address the vagueness and imprecision in the inputs, to make reliable and accurate estimates of effort. In this paper, we present an optimized fuzzy logic based framework for software development effort prediction. The said framework tolerates imprecision, incorporates experts knowledge, explains prediction rationale through rules, offers transparency in the prediction system, and could adapt to changing environments with the availability of new data. The traditional cost estimation model COCOMO is extended in the proposed study by incorporating the concept of fuzziness into the measurements of size, mode of development for projects and the cost drivers contributing to the overall development effort.",cs

374,"Influence Process Structural Learning and the Emergence of Collective
  Intelligence","Recent work [Hazy 2012] has demonstrated computationally that collectives that are organized into networks which govern the flow of resources can learn to recognize newly emerging opportunities distributed in the environment. This paper argues that the system does this through a process analogous to neural network learning with relative status playing the role of synaptic weights. Hazy showed computationally that learning of this type can occur even when resource allocation decision makers have no direct visibility into the environment, have no direct understanding of the opportunity, and are not involved in their exploitation except to the extent that they evaluate the success or failure of funded projects. Effectively, the system of interactions learns which individuals have the best access to information and other resources within the ecosystem. Hazy [2012] calls this previously unidentified emergence phenomenon: Influence Process Structural Learning (IPSL). In the prior model of IPSL, a three-tiered organizational structure was predetermined in the model design [Hazy 2012]. These initial conditions delimit the extent to which the emergence of collective intelligence can be posited because the model itself assumes a defined structure. This work contributes to the field by extending the IPSL argument for collective intelligence to a holistic emergence argument. It begins by briefly reviewing previously published work. It continues the conversation by adding two additional steps: Firstly, it shows how a three-tier organizing structure might emerge through known complexity mechanisms. In this case the mechanism identified is preferential attachment [Barabasi 2002]. Secondly, the paper shows how collective intelligence can emerge within a system of agents when the influence structure among these agents is treated as a the genetic algorithm.",cs
375,Towards an explanatory and computational theory of scientific discovery,"We propose an explanatory and computational theory of transformative discoveries in science. The theory is derived from a recurring theme found in a diverse range of scientific change, scientific discovery, and knowledge diffusion theories in philosophy of science, sociology of science, social network analysis, and information science. The theory extends the concept of structural holes from social networks to a broader range of associative networks found in science studies, especially including networks that reflect underlying intellectual structures such as co-citation networks and collaboration networks. The central premise is that connecting otherwise disparate patches of knowledge is a valuable mechanism of creative thinking in general and transformative scientific discovery in particular.",cs

The model is based on the stable matching theory which is applied to systems with a global ranking utility function. We consider the dynamics of peers searching for efficient collaborators and we prove that a unique stable solution exists. We prove that the system converges towards the stable solution and analyze its speed of convergence. We also study the stratification properties of the model, both when all collaborations are possible and for random possible collaborations. We present the corresponding fluid limit on the choice of collaborators in the random case. As a practical example, we study the BitTorrent Tit-for-Tat policy. For this system, our model provides an interesting insight on peer download rates and a possible way to optimize peer strategy.",cs
378,Branch-and-Prune Search Strategies for Numerical Constraint Solving,"When solving numerical constraints such as nonlinear equations and inequalities, solvers often exploit pruning techniques, which remove redundant value combinations from the domains of variables, at pruning steps. To find the complete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with branching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the so-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for solving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that uses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection search. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions are isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums of solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper, we propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants, which not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case, but also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case. These new search algorithms enable us to employ various pruning techniques in the construction of inner and outer approximations of the solution set. Our experiments show that these algorithms speed up the solving process often by one order of magnitude or more when solving problems with continuums of solutions, while keeping the same performance as the bisection search when the solutions are isolated.",cs

  Uncertainties","Robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task in the development of practical quantum technology. In this paper, we present a systematic numerical methodology of sampling-based learning control (SLC) for control design of quantum systems with Hamiltonian uncertainties. The SLC method includes two steps of ""training"" and ""testing and evaluation"". In the training step, an augmented system is constructed by sampling uncertainties according to possible distributions of uncertainty parameters. A gradient flow based learning and optimization algorithm is adopted to find the control for the augmented system. In the process of testing and evaluation, a number of samples obtained through sampling the uncertainties are tested to evaluate the control performance. Numerical results demonstrate the success of the SLC approach. The SLC method has potential applications for robust control design of quantum systems.",cs

381,"Congestion Management for Mobility-on-Demand Schemes that use Electric
  Vehicles","To date the majority of commuters use their privately owned vehicle that uses an internal combustion engine. This transportation model suffers from low vehicle utilization and causes environmental pollution. This paper studies the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) operating in a Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) scheme and tackles the related management challenges. We assume a number of customers acting as cooperative agents requesting a set of alternative trips and EVs distributed across a number of pick-up and drop-off stations. In this setting, we propose congestion management algorithms which take as input the trip requests and calculate the EV-to-customer assignment aiming to maximize trip execution by keeping the system balanced in terms of matching demand and supply. We propose a Mixed-Integer-Programming (MIP) optimal offline solution which assumes full knowledge of customer demand and an equivalent online greedy algorithm that can operate in real time. The online algorithm uses three alternative heuristic functions in deciding whether to execute a customer request: (a) The sum of squares of all EVs in all stations, (b) the percentage of trips' destination location fullness and (c) a random choice of trip execution. Through a detailed evaluation, we observe that (a) provides an increase of up to 4.8% compared to (b) and up to 11.5% compared to (c) in terms of average trip execution, while all of them achieve close to the optimal performance. At the same time, the optimal scales up to settings consisting of tenths of EVs and a few hundreds of customer requests.",cs

Dynamic power has been the dominant part of power dissipation in CMOS circuits, however, in future technologies the static portion of power dissipation will outreach the dynamic portion. This paper proposes an efficient technique to reduce both dynamic and static power dissipation in scan structures. Scan cell outputs which are not on the critical path(s) are multiplexed to fixed values during scan mode. These constant values and primary inputs are selected such that the transitions occurred on non-multiplexed scan cells are suppressed and the leakage current during scan mode is decreased. A method for finding these vectors is also proposed. Effectiveness of this technique is proved by experiments performed on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits.",cs

Unlike previously known algorithms, which are recursive in nature, our method can be implemented directly on top of any DBMS. Our method is based on the new notion of a laconic schema mapping. A laconic schema mapping is a schema mapping for which the canonical universal solution is the core universal solution. We give a procedure by which every schema mapping specified by FO s-t tgds can be turned into a laconic schema mapping specified by FO s-t tgds that may refer to a linear order on the domain of the source instance. We show that our results are optimal, in the sense that the linear order is necessary and the method cannot be extended to schema mapping involving target constraints.",cs
389,A Probabilistic Model of Machine Translation,"A probabilistic model for computer-based generation of a machine translation system on the basis of English-Russian parallel text corpora is suggested. The model is trained using parallel text corpora with pre-aligned source and target sentences. The training of the model results in a bilingual dictionary of words and ""word blocks"" with relevant translation probability.",cs
390,Hard instance generation for SAT,"We propose an algorithm of generating hard instances for the Satisfying Assignment Search Problem (in short, SAT). The algorithm transforms instances of the integer factorization problem into SAT instances efficiently by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. For example, it is possible to construct SAT instances with about 5,600 variables that is as hard as factorizing 100 bit integers.",cs
391,"(Extended Version) Algebraic Characterization of the Class of Languages
  recognized by Measure Only Quantum Automata","We study a model of one-way quantum automaton where only measurement operations are allowed ($\mon$). We give an algebraic characterization of $\lmo(\Sigma)$, showing that the syntactic monoids of the languages in $\lmo(\Sigma)$ are exactly the $J$-trivial literally idempotent syntactic monoids, where $J$ is the Green's relation determined by two-sided ideals. We also prove that $\lmo(\Sigma)$ coincides with the literal variety of literally idempotent piecewise testable regular languages. This allows us to prove the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a regular language belongs to $\lmo(\Sigma)$ and to discuss definability issues in terms of the existential first-order logic $\Sigma_1[<]$ and the linear temporal logic without the next operator LTLWN.",cs
392,Modelling Mobility: A Discrete Revolution,"We introduce a new approach to model and analyze \emph{Mobility}. It is fully based on discrete mathematics and yields a class of mobility models, called the \emph{Markov Trace} Model. This model can be seen as the discrete version of the \emph{Random Trip} Model including all variants of the \emph{Random Way-Point} Model \cite{L06}.   We derive fundamental properties and \emph{explicit} analytical formulas for the \emph{stationary distributions} yielded by the Markov Trace Model. Such results can be exploited to compute formulas and properties for concrete cases of the Markov Trace Model by just applying counting arguments.   We apply the above general results to the discrete version of the \emph{Manhattan Random Way-Point} over a square of bounded size.   We get formulas for the total stationary distribution and for two important \emph{conditional} ones: the agent spatial and destination distributions. Our method makes the analysis of complex mobile systems a feasible task.   As a further evidence of this important fact, we first model a complex vehicular-mobile system over a set of crossing streets. Several concrete issues are implemented such as parking zones, traffic lights, and variable vehicle speeds. By using a \emph{modular} version of the Markov Trace Model, we get explicit formulas for the stationary distributions yielded by this vehicular-mobile model as well.",cs
393,"Topic Model Based Behaviour Modeling and Clustering Analysis for
  Wireless Network Users","User behaviour analysis based on traffic log in wireless networks can be beneficial to many fields in real life: not only for commercial purposes, but also for improving network service quality and social management. We cluster users into groups marked by the most frequently visited websites to find their preferences. In this paper, we propose a user behaviour model based on Topic Model from document classification problems. We use the logarithmic TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document frequency) weighing to form a high-dimensional sparse feature matrix. Then we apply LSA (Latent semantic analysis) to deduce the latent topic distribution and generate a low-dimensional dense feature matrix. K-means++, which is a classic clustering algorithm, is then applied to the dense feature matrix and several interpretable user clusters are found. Moreover, by combining the clustering results with additional demographical information, including age, gender, and financial information, we are able to uncover more realistic implications from the clustering results.",cs
394,Charted Metropolis Light Transport,"In this manuscript, inspired by a simpler reformulation of primary sample space Metropolis light transport, we derive a novel family of general Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms called charted Metropolis-Hastings, that introduces the notion of sampling charts to extend a given sampling domain and making it easier to sample the desired target distribution and escape from local maxima through coordinate changes. We further apply the novel algorithms to light transport simulation, obtaining a new type of algorithm called charted Metropolis light transport, that can be seen as a bridge between primary sample space and path space Metropolis light transport. The new algorithms require to provide only right inverses of the sampling functions, a property that we believe crucial to make them practical in the context of light transport simulation. We further propose a method to integrate density estimation into this framework through a novel scheme that uses it as an independence sampler.",cs
395,"StegNet: Mega Image Steganography Capacity with Deep Convolutional
  Network","Traditional image steganography often leans interests towards safely embedding hidden information into cover images with payload capacity almost neglected. This paper combines recent deep convolutional neural network methods with image-into-image steganography. It successfully hides the same size images with a decoding rate of 98.2% or bpp (bits per pixel) of 23.57 by changing only 0.76% of the cover image on average. Our method directly learns end-to-end mappings between the cover image and the embedded image and between the hidden image and the decoded image. We~further show that our embedded image, while with mega payload capacity, is still robust to statistical analysis.",cs
396,Homing Vector Automata,"We introduce homing vector automata, which are finite automata augmented by a vector that is multiplied at each step by a matrix determined by the current transition, and have to return the vector to its original setting in order to accept the input. The computational power of the deterministic, nondeterministic and blind versions of these real-time machines are examined and compared to various related types of automata. A generalized version of the Stern-Brocot encoding method, suitable for representing strings on arbitrary alphabets, is also developed.",cs
397,Polarized User and Topic Tracking in Twitter,"Digital traces of conversations in micro-blogging platforms and OSNs provide information about user opinion with a high degree of resolution. These information sources can be exploited to under- stand and monitor collective behaviors. In this work, we focus on polarization classes, i.e., those topics that require the user to side exclusively with one position. The proposed method provides an iterative classification of users and keywords: first, polarized users are identified, then polarized keywords are discovered by monitoring the activities of previously classified users. This method thus allows tracking users and topics over time. We report several experiments conducted on two Twitter datasets during political election time-frames. We measure the user classification accuracy on a golden set of users, and analyze the relevance of the extracted keywords for the ongoing political discussion.",cs
398,"Influence of the Forward Difference Scheme for the Time Derivative on
  the Stability of Wave Equation Numerical Solution","Research on numerical stability of difference equations has been quite intensive in the past century. The choice of difference schemes for the derivative terms in these equations contributes to a wide range of the stability analysis issues - one of which is how a chosen scheme may directly or indirectly contribute to such stability. In the present paper, how far the forward difference scheme for the time derivative in the wave equation influences the stability of the equation numerical solution, is particularly investigated. The stability analysis of the corresponding difference equation involving four schemes, namely Lax's, central, forward, and rearward differences, were carried out, and the resulting stability criteria were compared. The results indicate that the instability of the solution of wave equation is not always due to the forward difference scheme for the time derivative. Rather, it is shown in this paper that the stability criterion is still possible when the spatial derivative is represented by an appropriate difference scheme. This sheds light on the degree of applicability of a difference scheme for a hyperbolic equation.",cs
399,Playing With Population Protocols,"Population protocols have been introduced as a model of sensor networks consisting of very limited mobile agents with no control over their own movement: A collection of anonymous agents, modeled by finite automata, interact in pairs according to some rules.   Predicates on the initial configurations that can be computed by such protocols have been characterized under several hypotheses.   We discuss here whether and when the rules of interactions between agents can be seen as a game from game theory. We do so by discussing several basic protocols.",cs
400,"The role of colour preattentive processing in human-computer interaction
  task efficiency: a preliminary study","In this paper, results of experimental research on the preattentive mechanism in the human-computer interaction (HCI) were presented. Fifty four subjects were asked to find interface elements from various panel structures. The arrangements were differentiated by their orientation (vertical, horizontal), colour pattern (ordered, unordered) and object background colours (green-blue, green-red, blue-red). The main finding of the study generally confirms the profits provided by the visual preattentive processing of the colour feature in graphical panel operation efficiency. However, the vertical way of arranging the items in search layouts resulted in decreasing the preattentive effect related to the item background colour. In regular, chessboard-like patterns of different coloured items, the effect of the early vision was less salient than in the case of structures with randomly dispersed colours. The reported results can help in designing efficient graphical user-computer interfaces in many interactive information systems.",cs
401,Motivic nature of character values of depth-zero representations,It is shown that the values of Harish-Chandra distribution characters on definable compact subsets of the set of topologically unipotent elements of symplectic or special orthogonal p-adic groups can be expressed as the trace of Frobenius action on virtual Chow motives. The result is restricted to a class of depth-zero representations that can be obtained by inflation from Deligne-Lusztig representations. The proof relies on arithmetic motivic integration.,math

  generating set","The Hanna Neumann conjecture states that if F is a free group, then for all finitely generated subgroups H,K <= F, rank(H intersect K) - 1 <= [ rank(H)-1 ] [ rank(K)-1 ] In this paper, we show that if one of the subgroups, say H, has a generating set consisting of only positive words, then H is not part of any counterexample to the conjecture. We further show that if H <= F({a,b}) is part of a counterexample to the conjecture, then its folding Gamma_H must contain source and/or sink vertices.",math
404,Persistent laminations from Seifert surfaces,"A persistent lamination for a knot K is an essential lamination in the complement of K, which remains essential after every non-trivial Dehn surgery along K. Having a persistent lamination implies, for example, that every manifold obtained by non-trivial Dehn surgery along K has universal cover R^3. In this paper we present a method for building persistent laminations for knots from an incompressible Seifert surface for some `parent' knot. Using this construction, we can, for example, currently build persistent laminations for approximately 45 percent of the knots in the standard knot tables; see page 12 of the paper, or http://www.math.unt.edu/~britten/ldt/knots/knotlst1.html, for the exact list.",math

407,An Orthogonal Discrete Auditory Transform,"An orthogonal discrete auditory transform (ODAT) from sound signal to spectrum is constructed by combining the auditory spreading matrix of Schroeder et al and the time one map of a discrete nonlocal Schr\""odinger equation. Thanks to the dispersive smoothing property of the Schr\""odinger evolution, ODAT spectrum is smoother than that of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) consistent with human audition. ODAT and DFT are compared in signal denoising tests with spectral thresholding method. The signals are noisy speech segments. ODAT outperforms DFT in signal to noise ratio (SNR) when the noise level is relatively high.",math
408,"Causal Inference for Complex Longitudinal Data: The Continuous Time
  g-Computation Formula","We extend Robins' theory of causal inference for complex longitudinal data to the case of continuously varying as opposed to discrete covariates and treatments. In particular we establish versions of the key results of the discrete theory: the g-computation formula and a collection of powerful characterizations of the g-null hypothesis of no treatment effect. This is accomplished under natural continuity hypotheses concerning the conditional distributions of the outcome variable and of the covariates given the past. We also show that our assumptions concerning counterfactual variables place no restriction on the joint distribution of the observed variables: thus in a precise sense, these assumptions are ""for free,"" or if you prefer, harmless.",math
409,"Identification of Parameters through the Approximate Periodic Solutions
  of a Parabolic System","This work is concerned with the identification problem for what we call the perturbation term or error term in a parabolic partial differential equation, through its approximate periodic solutions. The observation is made over a subregion of the physical domain. The existence and uniqueness problem of the approximate periodic solutions is studied in the first part of the paper. A solution to the identification problem is given in the second part of the paper. The main ingredients to be used include the classical Garlerkin method and the more recently developed Carleman estimates for a parabolic system.",math
410,Stability properties for a compactly supported prescale function,"We show that if $\phi$ is a continuous, minimally supported prescale function, then its translates are linearly independent on any set of positive measure in the unit interval. This generalizes results of Y. Meyer and P. G. Lemarie.   This result implies that a stability condition, introduced by Gundy and Kazarian for the study of local convergence of spline wavelet expansions, is satisfied for all expansions arizing from multiresolution analyses generated by such prescale functions $\phi$.",math
411,Phantom elements and its Applications,"In our previous work, a relation between Tsukiyama problem about self homotopy equivalence was found by using a generalization of phantom map.

Application to Forgetful map is also discussed briefly.",math

We show that $G$ also acts on the Hochschild cohomology algebra $HH^{\bullet}(A)$ and that there is a monomorphism of rings $HH^{\bullet}(A)^G \hookrightarrow HH^{\bullet}(A[G])$. That allows us to show the existence of a monomorphism from $HH^{\bullet}(\widetilde{A})^G$ into $HH^{\bullet}(A)$, where $\widetilde{A}$ is a Galois covering with group $G$.",math

When some of the variables are much larger than the others, asymptotic approximations with error bounds are presented. In most cases they are derived from a uniform approximation to the integrand. As an application the symmetric elliptic integrals of the first, second, and third kinds are proved to be linearly independent with respect to coefficients that are rational functions.",math
416,Gromov-Witten invariants of blow-ups,"In the first part of the paper, we give an explicit algorithm to compute the (genus zero) Gromov-Witten invariants of blow-ups of an arbitrary convex projective variety in some points if one knows the Gromov-Witten invariants of the original variety. In the second part, we specialize to blow-ups of P^r and show that many invariants of these blow-ups can be interpreted as numbers of rational curves on P^r having specified global multiplicities or tangent directions in the blown-up points. We give various numerical examples, including a new easy way to determine the famous multiplicity d^{-3} for d-fold coverings of rational curves on the quintic threefold, and, as an outlook, two examples of blow-ups along subvarieties, whose Gromov-Witten invariants lead to classical multisecant formulas.",math

We prove that the dyadic doubling reverse H\""older classes $\RHp$ are not preserved under the $\lb$-operation, but the dyadic doubling $A_p$ classes $\Ap$ are preserved for $0<\lb <1$. We give an application to the structure of resolvent sets of dyadic paraproduct operators.",math
418,Discrete torsion for the supersingular orbifold sigma genus,"The first purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between equivariant elliptic genera and orbifold elliptic genera. We apply the character theory of Hopkins et. al. to the Borel-equivariant genus associated to the sigma orientation of Ando-Hopkins-Strickland to define an orbifold genus for certain total quotient orbifolds and supersingular elliptic curves. We show that our orbifold genus is given by the same sort of formula as the orbifold ``two-variable'' genus of Dijkgraaf et al. In the case of a finite cyclic orbifold group, we use the characteristic series for the two-variable genus to define an analytic equivariant genus in Grojnowski's equivariant elliptic cohomology, and we show that this gives precisely the orbifold two-variable genus. The second purpose of this paper is to study the effect of varying the BU<6>-structure in the Borel-equivariant sigma orientation. We show that varying the BU<6>-structure by a class in the third cohomology of the orbifold group produces discrete torsion in the sense of Vafa. This result was first obtained by Sharpe, for a different orbifold genus and using different methods.",math
419,Best Choice from the Planar Poisson Process,"Various best-choice problems related to the planar homogeneous Poisson process in finite or semi-infinite rectangle are studied. The analysis is largely based on properties of the one-dimensional box-area process associated with the sequence of records.

We then show an application of this result in the study of the regular deformations of completely integrable systems.",math
422,Solving the sextic by iteration: A complex dynamical approach,"Recently, Peter Doyle and Curt McMullen devised an iterative solution to the fifth degree polynomial. At the method's core is a rational mapping of the Riemann sphere with the icosahedral symmetry of a general quintic. Moreover, this map posseses ""reliable"" dynamics: for almost any initial point, the its trajectory converges to one of the periodic cycles that comprise an icosahedral orbit. This symmetry-breaking provides for a reliable or ""generally-convergent"" quintic-solving algorithm: with almost any fifth-degree equation, associate a rational mapping that has reliable dynamics and whose attractor consists of points from which one computes a root.   An algorithm that solves the sixth-degree equation requires a dynamical system with the symmetry of the alternating group on six things. This group does not act on the Riemmann sphere, but does act on the complex projective plane--this is the Valentiner group. The present work exploits the resulting 2-dimensional geometry in finding a Valentiner-symmetric rational mapping whose elegant dynamics experimentally appear to be reliable in the above sense---transferred to the 2-dimensional setting. This map provides the central feature of a conjecturally-reliable sextic-solving algorithm analogous to that employed in the quintic case.",math

427,On asymptotic nonlocal symmetry of nonlinear Schrödinger equations,"A concept of asymptotic symmetry is introduced which is based on a definition of symmetry as a reducibility property relative to a corresponding invariant ansatz. It is shown that the nonlocal Lorentz invariance of the free-particle Schr\""odinger equation, discovered by Fushchych and Segeda in 1977, can be extended to Galilei-invariant equations for free particles with arbitrary spin and, with our definition of asymptotic symmetry, to many nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations. An important class of solutions of the free Schr\""odinger equation with improved smoothing properties is obtained.",math

431,"Breakdown points for maximum likelihood estimators of location-scale
  mixtures","ML-estimation based on mixtures of Normal distributions is a widely used tool for cluster analysis. However, a single outlier can make the parameter estimation of at least one of the mixture components break down. Among others, the estimation of mixtures of t-distributions by McLachlan and   Peel [Finite Mixture Models (2000) Wiley, New York] and the addition of a further mixture component accounting for ``noise'' by Fraley and Raftery   [The Computer J. 41 (1998) 578-588] were suggested as more robust alternatives.   In this paper, the definition of an adequate robustness measure for cluster analysis is discussed and bounds for the breakdown points of the mentioned methods are given. It turns out that the two alternatives, while adding stability in the presence of outliers of moderate size, do not possess a substantially better breakdown behavior than estimation based on Normal mixtures. If the number of clusters s is treated as fixed, r additional points suffice for all three methods to let the parameters of r clusters explode. Only in the case of r=s is this not possible for t-mixtures. The ability to estimate the number of mixture components, for example, by use of the Bayesian information criterion of Schwarz [Ann. Statist. 6 (1978)   461-464], and to isolate gross outliers as clusters of one point, is crucial for an improved breakdown behavior of all three techniques. Furthermore, a mixture of Normals with an improper uniform distribution is proposed to achieve more robustness in the case of a fixed number of components.",math
432,Integral closures of ideals in completions of regular local domains,"In this paper we exhibit an example of a three-dimensional regular local domain (A, n) having a height-two prime ideal P with the property that the extension PA^ of P to the n-adic completion A^ of A is not integrally closed. We use a construction we have studied in earlier papers: For R=k[x,y,z], where k is a field of characteristic zero and x,y,z are indeterminates over k, the example A is an intersection of the localization of the power series ring k[y,z][[x]] at the maximal ideal (x,y,z) with the field k(x,y,z,f, g) where f, g are elements of (x,y,z)k[y,z][[x]] that are algebraically independent over k(x,y,z). The elements f, g are chosen in such a way that using results from our earlier papers A is Noetherian and it is possible to describe A as a nested union of rings associated to A that are localized polynomial rings over k in five variables.",math

In particular, we determine the optimal strategies for the problem of maximizing the utility of goodwill at launch time and minimizing the disutility of a stream of advertising costs that extends until the launch time for some classes of stochastic perturbations of the classical Nerlove-Arrow dynamics. We also consider some generalizations such as problems with constrained budget and with discretionary launching.",math

The potential of the barriers has the form V(phi)=xi(phi^2-phi_0^2)^2; xi is very large and phi_0 very close to zero, the product (xi phi_0^2) being finite and small. This is equivalent to the insertion of a suitable constraint in the functional integral for phi. The Green function contains a double Fourier transform of the characteristic function of the region where the potential has support.",math

437,Small deviations in p-variation for stable processes,"Let $\{Z_t, t\geq 0\}$ be a strictly stable process on $\R$ with index $\alpha\in (0,2]$. We prove that for every $p > \alpha$, there exists $\gamma = \gamma (\alpha, p)$ and $\k = \k (\alpha, p)\in (0, +\infty)$ such that $$\lim_{\ee\downarrow 0}\ee^{\gamma}\log\pb\lcr ||Z||_{p}\leq \ee \rcr = - \k,$$ where $||Z||_{p}$ stands for the strong $p$-variation of $Z$ on $[0,1]$. The critical exponent $\gamma (\alpha, p)$ takes a different shape according as $|Z|$ is a subordinator and $p >1$, or not. The small ball constant $\k (\alpha, p)$ is explicitly computed when $p \leq 1$, and a lower bound on $\k (\alpha, p)$ is easily obtained in the general case. In the symmetric case and when $p > 2$, we can also give an upper bound on $\k (\alpha, p)$ in terms of the Brownian small ball constant under the $(1/p)$-H\""older semi-norm. Along the way, we remark that the positive random variable $||Z||^p_{p}$ is not necessarily stable when $p > 1$, which gives a negative answer to an old question of P.~E.~Greenwood.",math

Consequently, the maximal $U({\cal H})$-equivariant compactification of the sphere in a Hilbert space $\cal H$ has no fixed points, which answers a 1987 question by Milman.   This is a version as of November 19, 1998, incorporating some revisions.",math
439,Interactions of Andronov-Hopf and Bogdamov-Takens bifurcations,"A codimension-three bifurcation, characterized by a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues and a nonsemisimple double zero eigenvalue, arises in the study of a pair of weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators with Z_2 + Z_2 symmetry. The methodology is based on Arnold's ideas of versal deformations of matrices for the linear analysis, and Poincar\'e normal forms for the nonlinear analysis of the system. The stratified subvariety of primary bifurcations of codimensions one and two is identified in the parameter space. The analysis reveals different types of solutions in the state space, including equilibria, limit cycles, invariant tori and the possibility of homoclinic chaos. A mechanism is identified for energy transfer without strong resonance between two oscillation modes with widely separated frequencies.",math
440,A Matroid Generalization of a Result on Row-Latin Rectangles,"Let A be an m \times n matrix in which the entries of each row are all distinct. Drisko showed that, if m \ge 2n-1, then A has a transversal: a set of n distinct entries with no two in the same row or column. We generalize this to matrices with entries in a matroid. For such a matrix A, we show that if each row of A forms an independent set, then we can require the transversal to be independent as well. We determine the complexity of an algorithm based on the proof of this result. Lastly, we observe that m \ge 2n-1 appears to force the existence of not merely one but many transversals. We discuss a number of conjectures related to this observation (some of which involve matroids and some of which do not).",math
441,A Remarkable Property of the Dynamic Optimization Extremals,"At the core of optimal control theory is the Pontryagin maximum principle - the celebrated first order necessary optimality condition - whose solutions are called extremals and which are obtained through a function called Hamiltonian, akin to the Lagrangian function used in ordinary calculus optimization problems. A remarkable property of the extremals is that the total derivative with respect to time of the corresponding Hamiltonian equals the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to time. In particular, when the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time, the value of the Hamiltonian evaluated along the extremals turns out to be constant (a property that corresponds to energy conservation in classical mechanics). We present a generalization of the above property. As applications of the new relation, methods for obtaining conserved quantities along the Pontryagin extremals and for characterizing problems possessing given constants of the motion are obtained.",math

446,On the divisible parts of quotient groups,"Techniques of combinatorial set theory are applied to the following algebraic problem. Suppose G is an abelian group such that, for all countable subgroups C, the divisible part of the quotient G/C is countable. What can one conclude about the size of the divisible part of G/K when the cardinality of the subgroup K is a given uncountable cardinal?",math
447,"Renormalization, large deviations and phase separation in Ising and
  percolation models","Phase separation is a fairly common physical phenomenon with examples including the formation of water droplets from humid air (fog, rain), the separation of a crystalline structure from an isotropic material such as a liquid or even the formation of the sizzling gas bubbles when a soda can is opened. It was recognized long ago (at least on a phenomenological level) that systems exhibiting several phases in equilibrium can be described with an appropriate variational principle: the phases arrange themselves in such a way that the energy associated with the phase boundaries is minimal. Typically this leads to an almost deterministic behavior and the phase boundaries are fairly regular. However, when looked at from a microscopic point of view, the system consists of a bunch of erratically moving molecules with relatively strong short-range interaction and the simplicity of the above macroscopic description looks more than miraculous. Indeed, when starting from the molecular level, there are many more questions to be asked and understood: which are the phases which we will see? why do only those occur? why are the phase boundaries sharp? how should we find (define) the energy associated with the interfaces? Only then can we ask the question: why does the system minimize this energy? It is only in the last decade that a mathematically satisfactory understanding of this phenomenon has been achieved. The main goal of the talk is to present the current state of affairs focusing thereby on results obtained in joint works with Raphael Cerf. The connection to fields of mathematics other than probability theory or statistical mechanics will be highlighted; namely, to geometric measure theory and to the calculus of variations.",math
448,"A Time-Dependent Born-Oppenheimer Approximation with Exponentially Small
  Error Estimates","We present the construction of an exponentially accurate time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer approximation for molecular quantum mechanics. We study molecular systems whose electron masses are held fixed and whose nuclear masses are proportional to $\epsilon^{-4}$, where $\epsilon$ is a small expansion parameter. By optimal truncation of an asymptotic expansion, we construct approximate solutions to the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation that agree with exact normalized solutions up to errors whose norms are bounded by $\ds C \exp(-\gamma/\epsilon^2)$, for some C and $\gamma>0$.",math
449,A Globally Convergent LCL Method for Nonlinear Optimization,"For optimization problems with nonlinear constraints, linearly constrained Lagrangian (LCL) methods sequentially minimize a Lagrangian function subject to linearized constraints. These methods converge rapidly near a solution but may not be reliable from arbitrary starting points. The well known example \MINOS\ has proven effective on many large problems. Its success motivates us to propose a globally convergent variant. Our stabilized LCL method possesses two important properties: the subproblems are always feasible, and they may be solved inexactly. These features are present in \MINOS only as heuristics.   The new algorithm has been implemented in \Matlab, with the option to use either the \MINOS or \SNOPT Fortran codes to solve the linearly constrained subproblems. Only first derivatives are required. We present numerical results on a nonlinear subset of the \COPS, \CUTE, and HS test-problem sets, which include many large examples. The results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the stabilized LCL procedure.",math
450,Solving simultaneously Dirac and Ricatti equations,"We analyse the behaviour of the Dirac equation in $d=1+1$ with Lorentz scalar potential. As the system is known to provide a physical realization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we take advantage of the factorization method in order to enlarge the restricted class of solvable problems. To be precise, it suffices to integrate a Ricatti equation to construct one-parameter families of solvable potentials. To illustrate the procedure in a simple but relevant context, we resort to a model which has proved useful in showing the phenomenon of fermion number fractionalization.",math
451,"Exponentially Accurate Semiclassical Dynamics: Propagation,
  Localization, Ehrenfest Times, Scattering and More General States","We prove six theorems concerning exponentially accurate semiclassical quantum mechanics. Two of these theorems are known results, but have new proofs. Under appropriate hypotheses, they conclude that the exact and approximate dynamics of an initially localized wave packet agree up to exponentially small errors in $\hbar$ for finite times and for Ehrenfest times. Two other theorems state that for such times the wave packets are localized near a classical orbit up to exponentially small errors. The fifth theorem deals with infinite times and states an exponentially accurate scattering result. The sixth theorem provides extensions of the other five by allowing more general initial conditions.",math
452,Balanced category theory,"Some aspects of basic category theory are developed in a finitely complete category $\C$, endowed with two factorization systems which determine the same discrete objects and are linked by a simple reciprocal stability law. Resting on this axiomatization of final and initial functors and discrete (op)fibrations, concepts such as components, slices and coslices, colimits and limits, left and right adjunctible maps, dense maps and arrow intervals, can be naturally defined in $\C$, and several classical properties concerning them can be effectively proved.   For any object $X$ of $\C$, by restricting $\C/X$ to the slices or to the coslices of $X$, two dual ""underlying categories"" are obtained. These can be enriched over internal sets (discrete objects) of $\C$: internal hom-sets are given by the components of the pullback of the corresponding slice and coslice of $X$. The construction extends to give functors $\C\to\Cat$, which preserve (or reverse) slices and adjunctible maps and which can be enriched over internal sets too.",math
453,Improving Dense Packings of Equal Disks in a Square,"We describe a new numerical procedure for generating dense packings of disks and spheres inside various geometric shapes. We believe that in some of the smaller cases, these packings are in fact optimal. When applied to the previously studied cases of packing n equal disks in a square, the procedure confirms all the previous record packings except for n = 32, 37, 48, and 50 disks, where better packings than those previously recorded are found. For n = 32 and 48, the new packings are minor variations of the previous record packings. However, for n = 37 and 50, the new patterns differ substantially. For example, they are mirror-symmetric, while the previous record packings are not.",math
454,Equivariant analogues of Zuckerman functors,"We review the Beilinson-Ginzburg construction of equivariant derived categories of Harish-Chandra modules, and introduce analogues of Zuckerman functors in this setting. They are given by an explicit formula, which works equally well in the case of modules with a given infinitesimal character, which is important if one wants to apply Beilinson-Bernstein localization. We also show how to recover the usual Zuckerman functors from the equivariant ones by passing to cohomology.",math
455,A characterisation of algebraic exactness,"An algebraically exact category in one that admits all of the limits and colimits which every variety of algebras possesses and every forgetful functor between varieties preserves, and which verifies the same interactions between these limits and colimits as hold in any variety. Such categories were studied by Ad\'amek, Lawvere and Rosick\'y: they characterised them as the categories with small limits and sifted colimits for which the functor taking sifted colimits is continuous. They conjectured that a complete and sifted-cocomplete category should be algebraically exact just when it is Barr-exact, finite limits commute with filtered colimits, regular epimorphisms are stable by small products, and filtered colimits distribute over small products. We prove this conjecture.",math
456,Symplectic Structures on Fiber Bundles,"Let $\pi: P\to B$ be a locally trivial fiber bundle over a connected CW complex $B$ with fiber equal to the closed symplectic manifold $(M,\om)$. Then $\pi$ is said to be a symplectic fiber bundle if its structural group is the group of symplectomorphisms $\Symp(M,\om)$, and is called Hamiltonian if this group may be reduced to the group $\Ham(M,\om)$ of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms. In this paper, building on prior work by Seidel and Lalonde, McDuff and Polterovich, we show that these bundles have interesting cohomological properties. In particular, for many bases $B$ (for example when $B$ is a sphere, a coadjoint orbit or a product of complex projective spaces) the rational cohomology of $P$ is the tensor product of the cohomology of $B$ with that of $M$. As a consequence the natural action of the rational homology $H_k(\Ham(M))$ on $H_*(M)$ is trivial for all $M$ and all $k > 0$.   Added: The erratum makes a small change to Theorem 1.1 concerning the characterization of Hamiltonian bundles.",math

458,Finite Part of Operator $K$-Theory for Groups with Rapid Decay,"In this paper we study the part of the $K$-theory of the reduced $C^*$-algebra arising from torsion elements of the group, and in particular we study the pairing of $K$-theory with traces and when traces can detect certain $K$-theory elements. In the case of groups with Property RD, we give a condition on the growth of conjugacy classes that determines whether they can be detected. Moreover, in the case that they can be detected, we show that nonzero elements in the part of the $K$-theory generated by torsion elements are not in the image of the assembly map $K^G_0(EG) \to K_0(C^*G)$. One application of this is a lower bound for the structure groups of certain manifolds.",math
459,A class of compact subsets for non-sober topological spaces,"We define a class of subsets of a topological space that coincides with the class of compact saturated subsets when the space is sober, and with enough good properties when the space is not sober.

460,Some Remarks on Braided Group Reconstruction and Braided Doubles,"The cross coproduct braided group $Aut(C) \rcocross B$ is obtained by Tannaka-Krein reconstruction from $C^B\to C$ for a braided group $B$ in braided category $C$. We apply this construction to obtain partial solutions to two problems in braided group theory, namely the tensor problem and the braided double. We obtain $Aut(C)\rcocross Aut(C)\isom Aut(C)\lcross Aut(C)$ and higher braided group `spin chains'. The example of the braided group $B(R)\lcross B(R)\lcross...\lcross B(R)$ is described explicitly by R-matrix relations. We also obtain $Aut(C)\rcocross Aut(C)^*$ as a dual quasitriangular `codouble' braided group by reconstruction from the dual category $C^\circ\to C$. General braided double crossproducts $B\dcross C$ are also considered.",math

More precisely, we consider a single conservation law, deduced from conservation of the number of cars, defined on a road network that is a collection of roads with junctions. The evolution problem is underdetermined at junctions, hence we choose to have some fixed rules for the distribution of traffic plus an optimization criteria for the flux. We prove existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions to the Cauchy problem.   Our method is based on wave front tracking approach, (B), and works also for boundary data and time dependent coefficients of traffic distribution at junctions, so including traffic lights.",math

468,Sequences of symmetric functions of binomial type,"We take advantage of the combinatorial interpretations of many sequences of polynomials of binomial type to define a sequence of symmetric functions corresponding to each sequence of polynomials of binomial type. We derive many of the results of Umbral Calculus in this context including a Taylor's expansion and a binomial identity for symmetric functions. Surprisingly, the delta operators for all the sequences of binomial type correspond to the same operator on symmetric functions.   On s'appuie ici sur les interpr\'etations combinatoires de nombreuses suites de polyn\^omes de type binomial pour d\'efinir une suite de fonctions sym\'etriques associ\'ee \`a chque suite de polyn\^omes de type binomial.

469,"Some problems of summability of spectral expansions connected with
  Laplace operator on sphere","Solution of some boundary value problems and initial problems in unique ball leads to the convergence and sumability problems of Fourier series of given function by eigenfunctions of Laplace operator on a sphere - spherical harmonics. Such a series are called as Fourier-Laplace series on sphere. There are a number of works devoted investigation of these expansions in different topologies and for the functions from the various functional spaces. In the present work we consider only localization problems in both usual and generalized (almost everywhere localization) senses in the classes of summable functions. We use Chezaro means of the partial sums for study of summability problems. In order to prove the main theorems we obtaine estimations for so called maximal operator estimating it by Hardy-Littlwood's maximal function. Significance of this function is that it majors of many important operators of mathematical physics. For instance, Hardy-Littlewood's maximal function majors Poisson's integral in the space.",math

In an earlier paper the authors showed that nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras can be constructed as finite-dimensional hyperK\""ahler quotient of a flat vector space. This paper uses that quotient construction to compute hyperK\""ahler potentials explicitly for orbits of elements with small Jordan blocks. It is seen that the K\""ahler potentials of Biquard and Gauduchon for SL(n)-orbits of elements with X^2=0, are in fact hyperK\""ahler potentials.",math

Let ${\cal{F}}$ be a family of $k$-derivations on $A$ and $M_{\cal{F}}$ the $A$-module spanned by ${\cal{F}}$. In this paper, we generalize a result due to A. Nowicki and construct an element $\partial$ of $M_{\cal{F}}$ such that $\ker \partial=\cap_{d\in {\cal{F}}} \ker d$. Such a derivation is called ${\cal{F}}$-minimal. Then we establish a density theorem for ${\cal{F}}$-minimal derivations in $M_{\cal{F}}$.",math

In the main part of the paper, on the basis of redefined concepts of a spatial derivative as well as of a residue of a complex function, the fundamental results of Cauchy's calculus of residues of analytic functions are generalized and the concept of total value of improper integral of complex function is defined. Finally, the results in the form of fundamental lemmas, which are more general with respect to the results of Jordan's fundamental lemmas of Cauchy's calculus of residues of analytic functions, are derived for the general class of scalar complex function whose defining domain is a complex plane.",math
474,Stability of a finite volume scheme for the incompressible fluids,We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the velocity and pressure are respectively piecewise constant and affine. We use a projection method to deal with the incompressibility constraint. We show that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes equations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. In particular we state an inf-sup (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. Using these properties we infer the stability of the scheme.,math

476,Computing Nearly Singular Solutions Using Pseudo-Spectral Methods,"In this paper, we investigate the performance of pseudo-spectral methods in computing nearly singular solutions of fluid dynamics equations. We consider two different ways of removing the aliasing errors in a pseudo-spectral method. The first one is the traditional 2/3 dealiasing rule. The second one is a high (36th) order Fourier smoothing which keeps a significant portion of the Fourier modes beyond the 2/3 cut-off point in the Fourier spectrum for the 2/3 dealiasing method. Both the 1D Burgers equation and the 3D incompressible Euler equations are considered. We demonstrate that the pseudo-spectral method with the high order Fourier smoothing gives a much better performance than the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule. Moreover, we show that the high order Fourier smoothing method captures about $12 \sim 15%$ more effective Fourier modes in each dimension than the 2/3 dealiasing method. For the 3D Euler equations, the gain in the effective Fourier codes for the high order Fourier smoothing method can be as large as 20% over the 2/3 dealiasing method. Another interesting observation is that the error produced by the high order Fourier smoothing method is highly localized near the region where the solution is most singular, while the 2/3 dealiasing method tends to produce oscillations in the entire domain. The high order Fourier smoothing method is also found be very stable dynamically. No high frequency instability has been observed.",math
477,"Prediction Properties of Aitken's Iterated Delta^2 Process, of Wynn's
  Epsilon Algorithm, and of Brezinski's Iterated Theta Algorithm","The prediction properties of Aitken's iterated Delta^2 process, Wynn's epsilon algorithm, and Brezinski's iterated theta algorithm for (formal) power series are analyzed. As a first step, the defining recursive schemes of these transformations are suitably rearranged in order to permit the derivation of accuracy-through-order relationships. On the basis of these relationships, the rational approximants can be rewritten as a partial sum plus an appropriate transformation term. A Taylor expansion of such a transformation term, which is a rational function and which can be computed recursively, produces the predictions for those coefficients of the (formal) power series which were not used for the computation of the corresponding rational approximant.",math

Motivated by this, we consider the more general situation of a semiregular hexagon of sides $a$, $a$ and $b$. We prove explicit formulas for the number of lozenge tilings of these hexagons containing the central unit rhombus, and obtain Propp's conjecture as a corollary of our results.",math

484,"Restricted algebras on inverse semigroups III, Fourier algebra","The Fourier and Fourier-Stieltjes algebras $A(G)$ and $B(G)$ of a locally compact group $G$ are introduced and studied in 60's by Piere Eymard in his PhD thesis. If $G$ is a locally compact abelian group, then $A(G)\simeq L^1(\hat{G})$, and $B(G)\simeq M(\hat{G})$, via the Fourier and Fourier-Stieltjes transforms, where $\hat{G}$ is the Pontryagin dual of $G$. Recently these algebras are defined on a (topological or measured) groupoid and have shown to share many common features with the group case. This is the last in a series of papers in which we have investigated a ""restricted"" form of these algebras on a unital inverse semigroup $S$.",math
485,Tilings and associated relational structures,"In the present paper, as we did previously in [7], we investigate the relations between the geometric properties of tilings and the algebraic properties of associated relational structures. Our study is motivated by the existence of aperiodic tiling systems. In [7], we considered tilings of the euclidean spaces of finite dimension, and isomorphism was defined up to translation. Here, we consider, more generally, tilings of a metric space, and isomorphism is defined modulo an arbitrary group of isometries.   In Section 1, we define the relational structures associated to tilings. The results of Section 2 concern local isomorphism, the extraction preorder and the characterization of relational structures which can be represented by tilings of some given type.   In Section 3, we show that the notions of periodicity and invariance through a translation, defined for tilings of the euclidean spaces of finite dimension, can be generalized, with appropriate hypotheses, to relational structures, and in particular to tilings of noneuclidean spaces.   The results of Section 4 are valid for uniformly locally finite relational structures, and in particular tilings, which satisfy the local isomorphism property. We characterize among such structures those which are locally isomorphic to structures without nontrivial automorphism. We show that, in an euclidean space of finite dimension, this property is true for a tiling which satisfies the local isomorphism property if and only if it is not invariant through a nontrivial translation. We illustrate these results with examples, some of them concerning aperiodic tilings systems of euclidean or noneuclidean spaces.",math

And it is shown that the tangent algebra determines the analytic type of the variety.",math

Besides the p-Laplacian-like eigenvalue problems we also deal with new and non-standard eigenvalue problems, which can not be solved by the methods used in nonlinear eigenvalue problems for p-Laplacians and similar operators. Original techniques are suggested for solving these new problems (see Section 3). In addition, dispersion relations between the eigen-parameters, quantitative analysis of eigenvectors and variational principles for eigenvalues of perturbed p-Laplacians are also studied in this paper. The problems, we study in this paper arise from the real world problems.",math

For background, we start with the categorical definition and go on to examine its algebraic formulation, which is applied to Morita equivalence and index. Then we consider the analytic construction, with particular emphasis on explaining why the RTP is not generally defined for every pair of vectors. We also look at recent work justifying a representation of RTPs as composition of unbounded operators, noting that these ideas work equally well for L^p modules.

We provide new proofs of Fesenko\rq s results that lead to a proof that the torsion free group $T =\{t+\sum_{k\geq 1} a_kt^{qk+1}: a_k \in \Bbb F_p\}$ is hereditarily just infinite, and by extending his work, we also demonstrate the existence of a new class of hereditarily just infinite subgroups of $\Cal J$ which have non-trivial torsion.",math
500,Exact cohomology sequences with integral coefficients for torus actions,"Using methods applied by Atiyah in equivariant K-theory, Bredon obtained exact sequences for the relative cohomologies (with rational coefficients) of the equivariant skeletons of (sufficiently nice) T-spaces, T=(S^1)^n, with free equivariant cohomology over the cohomology of BT. Here we characterise those finite T-CW complexes with connected isotropy groups for which an analogous result holds with integral coefficients.",math

From this, a result of S.~McKay is derived, which states that if ${\cal NQ}$ has instances of nonsurjective epimorphisms, then ${\cal N}$ also has instances of nonsurjective epimorphisms. Two partial converses to McKay's result are also given: when~$G$ is a finite nonabelian simple group; and when~$G$ is finite and ${\cal Q}$ is a product of varieties of nilpotent groups, each of which contains the infinite cyclic group.",math

Examples include hyperbolic buildings, Cayley graphs of word hyperbolic Coxeter systems, and generalizations of cubical complexes, that we call even polyhedral complexes. We use tools introduced by Tits in the case of automorphism groups of trees, and Davis-Moussong's geometric realisation of Coxeter systems.",math
503,Abelian surfaces in toric 4-folds,"We investigate the possibility of embedding minimal abelian surfaces in smooth toric 4-folds with Picard number 2. The existence of such an embedding imposes conditions on the 4-fold, which we partly describe. On the other hand, we exhibit such embeddings in a special case, using a simple description of morphisms into smooth toric varieties.",math

What is the least order finite group, $G_g$, for which there is a homomorphism $\psi$ from $\pi_1(F_g)$ to $G_g$ so that no nontrivial simple closed curve on $F_g$ represents an element in Ker($\psi$)? For the torus it is easily seen that $G_1 = Z_2 \times Z_2$ suffices. We prove here that $G_2$ is a group of order 32 and that an upper bound for the order of $G_g$ is given by $g^{2g +1}$. The previously known upper bound was greater than $2^{g{2^{2g}}}$.",math

It is also proved that the hyperspace of convex compact subsets of the Tychonov cube $I^{\omega_1}$ is homeomorphic to $I^{\omega_1}$. An analogous result is also proved for the cone over $I^{\omega_1}$. Our proofs are based on analysis of maps of hyperspaces of compact convex subsets, in particular, selection theorems for such maps are proved.",math
507,The modified Bargmann-Wigner formalism: The Higher Spins,"In the old articles of Ogievetskii and Polubarinov, Kalb and Ramond the notoph concept, the longitudinal field originated from the antisymmetric tensor (AST), has been proposed. In our work we analyze the theory of the AST field of the second rank from the viewpoint of the normalization problem. We obtain 4-potentials and strengths which coincide with those obtained in the works of Ahluwalia and Dvoeglazov. We conclude that it is possible to describe degrees of freedom of the photon and of the notoph explicitly by slightly modified Bargmann-Wigner field function. The physical consequences and relations to the previous works are discussed. Furthermore, we derive equations for the symmetric tensor of the second rank on the basis of the same modification of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism, i.e., the equations which describe the dynamical behavior of the field of the maximal spin 2.",math

We prove that $E$ is isometric to a subspace of the Lebesgue-Bochner space $L_p(X;F)$ only if $E$ is isometric to a subspace of $F.$ Moreover, every isometry $T$ from $E$ into $L_p(X;F)$ has the form $Te(x)=h(x)U(x)e, e\in E,$ where $h:X\rightarrow R$ is a measurable function and, for every $x\in X,$ $U(x)$ is an isometry from $E$ to $F.$",math

The center is shown to be isomorphic to $C(G/G_\rho^0)$ for a certain subgroup $G_\rho^0$ of $G$, and there is a 1-1 correspondence between normalised traces and probability measures on $G/G_\rho^0$. This makes it possible to represent the deformed algebra as operators over $L^2(G/\Gamma)$. Applications to K-theory are also mentioned.",math
514,Transience of percolation clusters on wedges,"We study random walks on supercritical percolation clusters on wedges in $\Z^3$, and show that the infinite percolation cluster is (a.s.) transient whenever the wedge is transient. This solves a question raised by O. Haggstrom and E. Mossel. We also show that for convex gauge functions satisfying a mild regularity condition, the existence of a finite energy flow on $Z^2$ is equivalent to the (a.s.) existence of a finite energy flow on the supercritical percolation cluster. This solves a question of C. Hoffman.",math

We also include the case of arbitrary signature $O(p,q)$. The changes in the type of representation can be seen as a rotation in the complex plane. The essential result is that adding a $(+)$ dimension performs a rotation by $\pi/4$ in the counter clock-wise sense, but for each $(-)$ sign in the metric, the rotation is clockwise.",math
516,An accurate finite element method for elliptic interface problems,A finite element method for elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients is presented. The discontinuity is assumed to take place along a closed smooth curve. The proposed method allows to deal with meshes that are not adapted to the discontinuity line. The (nonconforming) finite element space is enriched with local basis functions. We prove an optimal convergence rate in the $H^1$--norm. Numerical tests confirm the theoretical results.,math

Examples are given to illustrate various aspects of the density problem, in particular the shift in emphasis from the analysis of individual packings to spaces of packings.",math
518,Some geometric PDEs related to hydrodynamics and electrodynamics,"We discuss several geometric PDEs and their relationship with Hydrodynamics and classical Electrodynamics. We start from the Euler equations of ideal incompressible fluids that, geometrically speaking, describe geodesics on groups of measure preserving maps with respect to the $L^2$ metric. Then, we introduce a geometric approximation of the Euler equation, which involves the Monge-Amp\`ere equation and the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transportation theory. This equation can be interpreted as a fully nonlinear correction of the Vlasov-Poisson system that describes the motion of electrons in a uniform neutralizing background through Coulomb interactions. Finally we briefly discuss an equation for generalized extremal surfaces in the 5 dimensional Minkowski space, related to the Born-Infeld equations, from which the Vlasov-Maxwell system of classical Electrodynamics can be formally derived.",math

  applications to mappings","We construct a family of integral kernels for solving the \bar\partial equation with C^k and Holder estimates in thin tubes around totally real submanifolds in complex Eulidean spaces (theorems 1.1 and 3.1). Combining this with the proof of a theorem of Serre we solve the d-equation with estimates for holomorphic forms in such tubes (theorem 5.1). We apply these techniques and a method of Moser to approximate C^k-diffeomorphisms between totally real submanifolds in C^n in the C^k-topology by biholomorphic mappings in tubes, by unimodular and symplectic biholomorphic mappings, and by holomorphic automorphisms of C^n.",math
520,"Direct linearization method for nonlinear PDE's and the related kernel
  RBFs","The standard methodology handling nonlinear PDE's involves the two steps: numerical discretization to get a set of nonlinear algebraic equations, and then the application of the Newton iterative linearization or its variants to solve the nonlinear algebraic systems. Here we present an alternative strategy called direct linearization method (DLM). The DLM discretization algebraic equations of nonlinear PDE's is simply linear rather than nonlinear. The basic idea behind the DLM is that we see a nonlinear term as a new independent systematic variable and transfer a nonlinear PDE into a linear PDE with more than one independent variable. It is stressed that the DLM strategy can be applied combining any existing numerical discretization techniques. The resulting linear discretization equations can be either over-posed or well-posed. In particular, we also discuss how to create proper radial basis functions in conjunction with the DLM.",math
521,"Routine Controversies : Mathematical Challenges in Mersenne's
  Correspondence","Mathematical challenges punctuate the history of early modern mathematics. While cultural historians have attempted to contextualize these challenges among contemporary practices, in particular duels or advertisements in a competitive market, thus emphasizing their interpersonal and social dimensions, historians of mathematics have generally treated them as somewhat childish remnants of a pre-scientific age, that the advent of modern science and its Baconian ideal of efficient collaboration would soon bring to an end. However, the number of challenges did not decrease but rather multiplied inside one of the first scientific organizations aiming at cooperative work--Marin Mersenne's network. This paradox has suggested the focus of this article : to examine the role of challenges in the economy of mathematical exchange (and mathematical creation) in early modern France. Through examples of successful, but also of unsuccessful challenges, we shall see how challenges operated, not only as ""mises en sc\`ene"" of methodological oppositions, but also, and primarily, as links in a mathematical environment structured inside correspondences around the resolution of problems. This situation also exemplifies how controversies may have been a constitutive part of normal scientific activities--and not their disruption--while shaping their development in specific, limited directions.",math

The paper shows the dependence of the left (or right) distributivity constraint on other axioms. Hence, the paper shows the relation to the concepts of {\it distributivity category} due to M. L. Laplaza and {\it ring-like category} due to A. Frohlich and C.T.C Wall.   The center construction of an almost strict Ann-category is an example of an unsymmetric braided Ann-category.",math
524,"Geometry of quadratic polynomials: moduli, rigidity and local
  connectivity","A while ago MLC (the conjecture that the Mandelbrot set is locally connected) was proven for quasi-hyperbolic points by Douady and Hubbard, and for boundaries of hyperbolic components by Yoccoz. More recently Yoccoz proved MLC for all at most finitely renormalizable parameter values. One of our goals is to prove MLC for some infinitely renormalizable parameter values. Loosely speaking, we need all renormalizations to have bounded combinatorial rotation number (assumption C1) and sufficiently high combinatorial type (assumption C2).   For real quadratic polynomials of bounded combinatorial type the complex a priori bounds were obtained by Sullivan. Our result complements the Sullivan's result in the unbounded case. Moreover, it gives a background for Sullivan's renormalization theory for some bounded type polynomials outside the real line where the problem of a priori bounds was not handled before for any single polynomial.   An important consequence of a priori bounds is absence of invariant measurable line fields on the Julia set (McMullen) which is equivalent to quasi-conformal (qc) rigidity. To prove stronger topological rigidity we construct a qc conjugacy between any two topologically conjugate polynomials (Theorem III). We do this by means of a pull-back argument, based on the linear growth of moduli and a priori bounds. Actually the argument gives the stronger combinatorial rigidity which implies MLC.",math
525,Correlated samples with fixed and nonnormal latent variables,"A general structural equation model is fitted on a panel data set that consists of $I$ correlated samples. The correlated samples could be data from correlated populations or correlated observations from occasions of panel data. We consider cases in which the full pseudo-normal likelihood cannot be used, for example, in highly unbalanced data where the participating individuals do not appear in consecutive years. The model is estimated by a partial likelihood that would be the full and correct likelihood for independent and normal samples. It is proved that the asymptotic standard errors (a.s.e.'s) for the most important parameters and an overall-fit measure are the same as the corresponding ones derived under the standard assumptions of normality and independence for all the observations. These results are very important since they allow us to apply classical statistical methods for inference, which use only first- and second-order moments, to correlated and nonnormal data. Via a simulation study we show that the a.s.e.'s based on the first two moments have negligible bias and provide less variability than the a.s.e.'s computed by an alternative robust estimator that utilizes up to fourth moments. Our methodology and results are applied to real panel data, and it is shown that the correlated samples cannot be formulated and analyzed as independent samples. We also provide robust a.s.e.'s for the remaining parameters. Additionally, we show in the simulation that the efficiency loss for not considering the correlation over the samples is small and negligible in the cases with random and fixed variables.",math
526,"Dynamical resonances and SSF singularities for a magnetic Schroedinger
  operator","We consider the Hamiltonian $H$ of a 3D spinless non-relativistic quantum particle subject to parallel constant magnetic and non-constant electric field. The operator $H$ has infinitely many eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity embedded in its continuous spectrum. We perturb $H$ by appropriate scalar potentials $V$ and investigate the transformation of these embedded eigenvalues into resonances. First, we assume that the electric potentials are dilation-analytic with respect to the variable along the magnetic field, and obtain an asymptotic expansion of the resonances as the coupling constant $\varkappa$ of the perturbation tends to zero. Further, under the assumption that the Fermi Golden Rule holds true, we deduce estimates for the time evolution of the resonance states with and without analyticity assumptions; in the second case we obtain these results as a corollary of suitable Mourre estimates and a recent article of Cattaneo, Graf and Hunziker \cite{cgh}. Next, we describe sets of perturbations $V$ for which the Fermi Golden Rule is valid at each embedded eigenvalue of $H$; these sets turn out to be dense in various suitable topologies. Finally, we assume that $V$ decays fast enough at infinity and is of definite sign, introduce the Krein spectral shift function for the operator pair $(H+V, H)$, and study its singularities at the energies which coincide with eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity of the unperturbed operator $H$.",math
527,Reparametrizations of Continuous Paths,"A reparametrization (of a continuous path) is given by a surjective weakly increasing self-map of the unit interval. We show that the monoid of reparametrizations (with respect to compositions) can be understood via ``stop-maps'' that allow to investigate compositions and factorizations, and we compare it to the distributive lattice of countable subsets of the unit interval. The results obtained are used to analyse the space of traces in a topological space, i.e., the space of continuous paths up to reparametrization equivalence. This space is shown to be homeomorphic to the space of regular paths (without stops) up to increasing reparametrizations. Directed versions of the results are important in directed homotopy theory.",math

We characterize completely those pairs of complete graphs whose tensor products are circulant. We establish that if the orders of these circulant graphs have greatest common divisor of 2, the product is circulant whenever both graphs are bipartite. We also establish that it is possible for one of the two graphs not to be circulant and the product still to be circulant.",math
530,Exotic smooth structures on topological fibre bundles II,"We use a variation of a classical construction of A. Hatcher to construct virtually all stable exotic smooth structures on compact smooth manifold bundles whose fibers have sufficiently large odd dimension (at least twice the base dimension plus 3). Using a variation of the Dwyer-Weiss-Williams smoothing theory which we explain in a separate joint paper with Bruce Williams [11], we associate a homology class in the total space of the bundle to each exotic smooth structure and we show that the image of this class in the homology of the base is the Poincar\'e dual of the relative higher Igusa-Klein (IK) torsion invariant. This answers the question, in the relative case, of which cohomology classes can occur as relative higher torsion classes.",math
531,From Coherent Structures to Universal Properties,"Given a 2-category $\twocat{K}$ admitting a calculus of bimodules, and a 2-monad T on it compatible with such calculus, we construct a 2-category $\twocat{L}$ with a 2-monad S on it such that: (1)S has the adjoint-pseudo-algebra property. (2)The 2-categories of pseudo-algebras of S and T are equivalent. Thus, coherent structures (pseudo-T-algebras) are transformed into universally characterised ones (adjoint-pseudo-S-algebras). The 2-category $\twocat{L}$ consists of lax algebras for the pseudo-monad induced by T on the bicategory of bimodules of $\twocat{K}$. We give an intrinsic characterisation of pseudo-S-algebras in terms of representability. Two major consequences of the above transformation are the classifications of lax and strong morphisms, with the attendant coherence result for pseudo-algebras. We apply the theory in the context of internal categories and examine monoidal and monoidal globular categories (including their monoid classifiers) as well as pseudo-functors into $\Cat$.",math
532,Butterflies in a Semi-Abelian Context,"It is known that monoidal functors between internal groupoids in the category Grp of groups constitute the bicategory of fractions of the 2-category Grpd(Grp) of internal groupoids, internal functors and internal natural transformations in Grp with respect to weak equivalences. Monoidal functors can be described equivalently by a kind of weak morphisms introduced by B. Noohi under the name of ""butter ies"". In order to internalize monoidal functors in a wide context, we introduce the notion of internal butterflies between internal crossed modules in a semi-abelian category C, and we show that they are morphisms of a bicategory B(C): Our main result states that, when in C the notions of Huq commutator and Smith commutator coincide, then the bicategory B(C) of internal butterflies is the bicategory of fractions of Grpd(C) with respect to weak equivalences (that is, internal functors which are internally fully faithful and essentially surjective on objects).",math

In certain cases, these estimates are sharp: we give examples where equality is obtained.",math
536,Localization theorems by symplectic cuts,"Given a compact symplectic manifold M with the Hamiltonian action of a torus T, let zero be a regular value of the moment map, and M_0 the symplectic reduction at zero. Denote by \kappa_0 the Kirwan map H^*_T(M)-> H^*(M_0). For an equivariant cohomology class \eta\in H^*_T(M) we present new localization formulas which express \int_{M_0} \kappa_0(\eta) as sums of certain integrals over the connected components of the fixed point set M^T. To produce such a formula we apply a residue operation to the Atiyah-Bott-Berline-Vergne localization formula for an equivariant form on the symplectic cut of M with respect to a certain cone, and then, if necessary, iterate this process using other cones. When all cones used to produce the formula are one-dimensional we recover, as a special case, the localization formula of Guillemin and Kalkman. Using similar ideas, for a special choice of the cone (whose dimension is equal to that of T) we give a new proof of the Jeffrey-Kirwan localization formula.",math

We show that the cyclic module associated to the diagonal of $A \natural \mathcal{H}$ is isomorphic with the cyclic module of the crossed product algebra $A \rtimes \mathcal{H}$. This enables us to derive a spectral sequence for the cyclic homology of the crossed product algebra. We also construct a cocylindrical module for Hopf module coalgebras and establish a similar spectral sequence to compute the cyclic cohomology of crossed product coalgebras.",math
544,On Theodorus' lesson in the Theaetetus 147d-e,"In the celebrated Theaetetus 147d3-e1 passage Theodorus is giving a lesson to Theaetetus and his companion, proving certain quadratic incommensurabilities. The dominant view on this passage, expressed independently by H. Cherniss and M. Burnyeat, is that Plato has no interest to, and does not, inform the reader about Theodorus' method of incommensurability proofs employed in his lesson, and that, therefore, there is no way to decide from the Platonic text, our sole information on the lesson, whether the method is anthyphairetic as Zeuthen, Becker, van der Waerden suggest, or not anthyphairetic as Hardy-Wright, Knorr maintain.   The main part of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the evidence for a distributive rendering of the plural 'hai dunameis' in the crucial statement, 'because the powers ('hai dunameis') were shown to be infinite in multitude' in 147d7-8 (contrary to the Burnyeat collective, set-theoretic rendering), necessarily resulting in an anthyphairetic method for Theodorus' proofs of incommensurability (contrary to the Cherniss-Burnyeat neutrality thesis).",math
545,Bridged Links and Tangle Presentations of Cobordism Categories,"We develop a calculus of surgery data, called bridged links, which involves besides links also pairs of balls that describe one-handle attachements. As opposed to the usual link calculi of Kirby and others this description uses only elementary, local moves(namely modifications and isolated cancellations), and it is valid also on non-simply connected and disconnected manifolds. In particular, it allows us to give a presentation of a 3-manifold by doing surgery on any other 3-manifold with the same boundary. Bridged link presentations on unions of handlebodies are used to give a Cerf-theoretical derivation of presentations of 2+1-dimensional cobordisms categories in terms of planar ribbon tangles and their composition rules. As an application we give a different, more natural proof of the Matveev-Polyak presentations of the mapping class group, and, furthermore, find systematically surgery presentations of general mapping tori. We discuss a natural extension of the Reshetikhin Turaev invariant to the calculus of bridged links. Invariance follows now - similar as for knot invariants - from simple identifications of the elementary moves with elementary categorial relations for invariances or cointegrals, respectively. Hence, we avoid the lengthy computations and the unnatural Fenn-Rourke reduction of the original proofs. Moreover, we are able to start from a much weaker ``modularity''-condition, which implies the one of Turaev. Generalizations of the presentation to cobordisms of surfaces with boundaries are outlined.",math
546,Multiple Flag Varieties of Finite Type,"We classify all products of flag varieties with finitely many orbits under the diagonal action of the general linear group.

Our main tool is the theory of quiver representations.",math

We show that the map F tha goes from the closure of F_S to R^n and takes S' = (Q')^T Lambda Q' to diag(Q' Lambda (Q')^T) is a smooth bijection onto its range P_S, the convex hull of some subset of the n! permuatations of (lambda_1, ..., lambda_n).

Introducing their stable anti Yetter-Drinfeld modules and cocyclic modules, we compute their cyclic cohomology. Furthermore, we provide a pairing for the cyclic cohomology of x-Hopf algebras which generalizes the Connes-Moscovici characteristic map to x-Hopf algebras.

In particular, we show that for any $k \ge 2$, there is an irreducible curve with one place at infinity, which has at least $k$ inequivalent embeddings in $C^2$. Also, upon combining our method with a well-known theorem of Zaidenberg and Lin, we show that one can decide ""almost"" just by inspection whether or not a polynomial fiber is an irreducible simply connected curve.",math
550,Adaptive density estimation under dependence,"Assume that $(X_t)_{t\in\Z}$ is a real valued time series admitting a common marginal density $f$ with respect to Lebesgue's measure. Donoho {\it et al.} (1996) propose a near-minimax method based on thresholding wavelets to estimate $f$ on a compact set in an independent and identically distributed setting. The aim of the present work is to extend these results to general weak dependent contexts. Weak dependence assumptions are expressed as decreasing bounds of covariance terms and are detailed for different examples. The threshold levels in estimators $\widehat f_n$ depend on weak dependence properties of the sequence $(X_t)_{t\in\Z}$ through the constant. If these properties are unknown, we propose cross-validation procedures to get new estimators. These procedures are illustrated via simulations of dynamical systems and non causal infinite moving averages. We also discuss the efficiency of our estimators with respect to the decrease of covariances bounds.",math
551,Algebra versus analysis in the theory of flexible polyhedra,"Two basic theorems of the theory of flexible polyhedra were proven by completely different methods: R. Alexander used analysis, namely, the Stokes theorem, to prove that the total mean curvature remains constant during the flex, while I.Kh. Sabitov used algebra, namely, the theory of resultants, to prove that the oriented volume remains constant during the flex. We show that none of these methods can be used to prove the both theorems. As a by-product, we prove that the total mean curvature of any polyhedron in the Euclidean 3-space is not an algebraic function of its edge lengths.",math

554,Statistical modeling of causal effects in continuous time,"This article studies the estimation of the causal effect of a time-varying treatment on time-to-an-event or on some other continuously distributed outcome. The paper applies to the situation where treatment is repeatedly adapted to time-dependent patient characteristics. The treatment effect cannot be estimated by simply conditioning on these time-dependent patient characteristics, as they may themselves be indications of the treatment effect. This time-dependent confounding is common in observational studies. Robins [(1992) Biometrika 79 321--334, (1998b) Encyclopedia of Biostatistics 6 4372--4389] has proposed the so-called structural nested models to estimate treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounding. In this article we provide a conceptual framework and formalization for structural nested models in continuous time. We show that the resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, as conjectured in Robins [(1998b) Encyclopedia of Biostatistics 6 4372--4389], a test for whether treatment affects the outcome of interest can be performed without specifying a model for treatment effect. We illustrate the ideas in this article with an example.",math

556,"Embeddings of Banach Spaces into Banach Lattices and the Gordon-Lewis

Here $I$ denotes the identity operator on $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_\infty\otimes_m J(X)$ the canonical lattice tensor product. This result is originally due to G. Pisier (unpublished), but our proof is different. We then use this to characterize the Gordon-Lewis property $\GL$ in terms of embeddings into Banach lattices. Also other structures related to the $\GL$ are investigated.",math
557,An exploration of the permanent-determinant method,"The permanent-determinant method and its generalization, the Hafnian-Pfaffian method, are methods to enumerate perfect matchings of plane graphs that was discovered by P. W. Kasteleyn. We present several new techniques and arguments related to the permanent-determinant with consequences in enumerative combinatorics. Here are some of the results that follow from these techniques:   1. If a bipartite graph on the sphere with 4n vertices is invariant under the antipodal map, the number of matchings is the square of the number of matchings of the quotient graph.   2. The number of matchings of the edge graph of a graph with vertices of degree at most 3 is a power of 2.   3. The three Carlitz matrices whose determinants count a x b x c plane partitions all have the same cokernel.   4. Two symmetry classes of plane partitions can be enumerated with almost no calculation.",math

The values of these orbital integrals at the unit element in the Hecke algebra count points on varieties over finite fields. The construction, which is based on motivic integration, works both in characteristic zero and in positive characteristic. As an application, the Fundamental Lemma for this class of integrals is lifted from positive characteristic to characteristic zero. The results are based on a formula for orbital integrals as distributions inflated from orbits in the quotient spaces of the Moy-Prasad filtrations of the Lie algebra. This formula is established by Fourier analysis on these quotient spaces.",math

It is known that complete intersections are Roberts rings, and the first author proved that a determinantal ring is a Roberts ring precisely if it is complete intersection. Let A_d(n) denote the affine cone of the Grassmannian G_d(n) under the Plucker embedding. We determine which of the rings A_d(n) are Roberts rings.",math

In \cite{ss}, it was conjectured that the Alfeld-Schumaker formula actually holds for all $d \ge 2r+1$. In this note, we show that this is the best result possible; in particular, there exists a simplicial complex $\Delta$ such that for any $r$, the dimension of the spline space in degree $d=2r$ is not given by the formula of \cite{as}. The proof relies on the explicit computation of the nonvanishing of the first local cohomology module described in \cite{ss2}.",math

Face lattices of convex polytopes are Eulerian. For Eulerian partially ordered sets, the flag vector can be encoded efficiently in the cd-index. The cd-index of a polytope has all positive entries. An important open problem is to give the broadest natural class of Eulerian posets having nonnegative cd-index. This paper completely determines which entries of the cd-index are nonnegative for all Eulerian posets. It also shows that there are no other lower or upper bounds on cd-coefficients (except for the coefficient of c^n).",math

It is shown that car assumptions have quite different implications depending on whether the underlying complete-data model is saturated or parametric. In the latter case, car assumptions can become inconsistent with observed data.",math

We obtain a sufficient condition for the Ball Generated Property (BGP), and conclude that Property $(II)$ implies the BGP, which, in turn, implies the space is nicely smooth. We show that the class of nicely smooth spaces is stable under $c_o$ and $\ell_p$ sums and also under finite $\ell_1$ sums; that being nicely smooth is not a three space property; and that the Bochner $L_p$ spaces are nicely smooth if and only if $X$ is both nicely smooth and Asplund.

574,Conformal invariance in two-dimensional percolation,"The immediate purpose of the paper was neither to review the basic definitions of percolation theory nor to rehearse the general physical notions of universality and renormalization (an important technique to be described in Part Two). It was rather to describe as concretely as possible, although in hypothetical form, the geometric aspects of universality, especially conformal invariance, in the context of percolation, and to present the numerical results that support the hypotheses. On the other hand, one ulterior purpose is to draw the attention of mathematicians to the mathematical problems posed by the physical notions. Some precise basic definitions are necessary simply to orient the reader. Moreover a brief description of scaling and universality on the one hand and of renormalization on the other is also essential in order to establish their physical importance and to clarify their mathematical content.",math

We show that their obstruction group vanishes in almost all, but not all, the hitherto unknown cases. It follows that if $n$ is not a power of a prime, or twice the power of a prime, then the genus is less than $n$.

Let the process be stationary with product Bernoulli invariant distribution at density \rho. Place a second class particle initially at the origin. For the case \rho different from 1/2 we show that the time spent by the second class particle at the origin has finite expectation. This strong transience is then used to prove that variances of additive functionals of local mean-zero functions are diffusive when \rho is not 1/2. As a corollary to previous work, we deduce the invariance principle for these functionals. The main arguments are comparisons of H_{-1} norms, a large deviation estimate for second-class particles, and a relation between occupation times of second-class particles and additive functional variances.",math

After publishing it in Trans. Am. Math.

We correct this in the e-print ""Addendum to K3 surfaces of genus 8 and varieties of sums of powers of cubic fourfolds"" (math.AG/0611533), where we establish that the general VSP(F,10) is in fact a new symplectic 4-fold different from the family of lines on a cubic 4-fold.",math

The cases for systems or PDEs with dissipation terms has never been extended. In this paper, we suggest a new extension for generalizing the multi-symplectic form for Hamiltonian systems to systems with dissipation which never have remarkable energy and momentum conservation properties. The central idea is that the PDEs is of a first-order type that has a symplectic structure depended explicitly on time variable, and decomposed into distinct components representing space and time directions. This suggest a natural definition of multi-symplectic Birkhoff's equation as a multi-symplectic structure from that a multi-symplectic dissipation law is constructed. We show that this definition leads to deeper understanding relationship between functional principle and PDEs. The concept of multi-symplectic integrator is also discussed.",math

594,"Needles and straw in haystacks: Empirical Bayes estimates of possibly
  sparse sequences","An empirical Bayes approach to the estimation of possibly sparse sequences observed in Gaussian white noise is set out and investigated. The prior considered is a mixture of an atom of probability at zero and a heavy-tailed density \gamma, with the mixing weight chosen by marginal maximum likelihood, in the hope of adapting between sparse and dense sequences. If estimation is then carried out using the posterior median, this is a random thresholding procedure. Other thresholding rules employing the same threshold can also be used. Probability bounds on the threshold chosen by the marginal maximum likelihood approach lead to overall risk bounds over classes of signal sequences of length n, allowing for sparsity of various kinds and degrees.   The signal classes considered are ``nearly black'' sequences where only a proportion \eta is allowed to be nonzero, and sequences with normalized \ell_p norm bounded by \eta, for \eta >0 and 0<p\le 2. Estimation error is measured by mean qth power loss, for 0<q\le 2. For all the classes considered, and for all q in (0,2], the method achieves the optimal estimation rate as n\to \infty and \eta \to 0 at various rates, and in this sense adapts automatically to the sparseness or otherwise of the underlying signal. In addition the risk is uniformly bounded over all signals. If the posterior mean is used as the estimator, the results still hold for q>1. Simulations show excellent performance.",math

600,Trees in renorming theory,"Trees are very agreeable objects to work with, offering a diversity of behaviour within a structure that is sufficiently simple to admit precise analysis. Thus we are able to offer fairly satisfactory necessary and sufficient conditions on a tree $\Upsilon $ for the existence of equivalent LUR or strictly convex norms on $\C_0(\Upsilon )$ and for norms with the Kadec Property. In particular, we show that for a {\sl finitely branching} tree $\Upsilon $ the space $\C_0(\Upsilon )$ admits a Kadec renorming. Since some finitely branching trees fail the condition for strictly convex renormability, we obtain an example of a Banach space that is Kadec renormable but not strictly convexifiable. Consideration of specially tailored examples enables us to answer the ``three-space problem'' for strictly convex renorming: there exists a Banach space $X$ with a closed subspace $Y$ such that both $Y$ and the quotient $X/Y$ admit strictly convex norms, while $X$ does not. We also solve a problem about the property of mid-point locally uniform convexity (MLUR), showing that this does not imply LUR renormability.",math

604,"A Stability Formula for Plastic-Tipped Bullets Part 1: Motivation and
  Development of New Formula","Part 1 of this paper describes a modification of the original Miller twist rule for computing gyroscopic bullet stability that is better suited to plastic-tipped bullets. The original Miller twist rule assumes a bullet of constant density, but it also works well for conventional copper (or gilding metal) jacketed lead bullets because the density of copper and lead are sufficiently close. However, the original Miller twist rule significantly underestimates the gyroscopic stability of plastic-tipped bullets, because the density of plastic is much lower than the density of copper and lead. Here, a new amended formula is developed for the gyroscopic stability of plastic-tipped bullets by substituting the length of just the metal portion for the total length in the $(1 + L^2)$ term of the original Miller twist rule. Part 2 describes experimental testing of this new formula on three plastic-tipped bullets. The new formula is relatively accurate for plastic-tipped bullets whose metal portion has nearly uniform density, but underestimates the gyroscopic stability of bullets whose core is significantly less dense than the jacket.",physics
605,"A comparison of new calculations of 10be production in the earths polar
  atmosphere by cosmic rays with 10be concentration measurements in polar ice
  cores between 1939-2005 - a troubling lack of concordance paper #1","Using new calculations of 10Be production in the Earths atmosphere which are based on direct measurements of the 11-year solar modulation effects on galactic cosmic rays and spacecraft measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, we have calculated the yearly average production of 10Be in the Earths atmosphere by galactic and solar cosmic rays since 1939. During the last six 11-year cycles the average amplitude of these production changes is 36%. These predictions are compared with measurements of 10Be concentration in polar ice cores in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere over the same time period. We find a large scatter between the predicted and measured yearly average data sets and a low cross correlation ~0.30. Also the normalized regression line slope between 10Be production changes and 10Be concentration changes is found to be only 0.4-0.6; much less than the value of 1.0 expected for a simple proportionality between these quantities, as is typically used for historical projections of the relationship between 10Be concentration and solar activity. The distribution of yearly averages in the 10Be concentration level in the data from the Dye-3 ice core in Greenland for the time period 1939-1985, contains a ""spike"" of high concentration one year averages which is not seen in the production calculations. These and other features suggest that galactic cosmic ray intensity changes which affect the production of 10Be in the Earths atmosphere are not the sole source of the 10Be concentration changes and confirm the importance of other effects, for example local and regional climatic effects, which could be of the same magnitude as the 10Be production changes.",physics

Most of the researchers therefore prefer the homogeneous model and suggest that the higher uplift rate before the end of deglaciation is the result of elastic contamination. It has been shown that the elastic deformation of the lithosphere is far too small to be responsible for the observed extra uplift; therefore, the homogeneous viscosity model should be discredited.   The homogeneous viscosity of the postglacial period and the high uplift rate of the late glacial period can be explained with a model which has an upper layer determining the homogeneous viscosity and the layer below it which has a low viscosity. The contribution to the uplift of this low viscosity layer is indistinguishable from an instantaneous uplift.   Current GPS deformation measurements indicating 10^21 Pas average viscosity for the lithosphere, which is consistent with this model. The viscosity of the low velocity zone should be between 10^18 Pas and 10^11 Pas. The lower constrain on the viscosity of the low velocity zone can be deduced from seismic observations. This viscosity model is consistent with post glacial rebounds and further supported by the lack of the dynamic topography.",physics
607,Attractiveness and activity in Internet communities,"Datasets of online communication often take the form of contact sequences -- ordered lists contacts (where a contact is defined as a triple of a sender, a recipient and a time). We propose measures of attractiveness and activity for such data sets and analyze these quantities for anonymized contact sequences from an Internet dating community. For this data set the attractiveness and activity measures show broad power-law like distributions. Our attractiveness and activity measures are more strongly correlated in the real-world data than in our reference model. Effects that indirectly can make active users more attractive are discussed.",physics
608,The Development of the College Park Tornado of 24 September 2001,"The 24 September 2001 College Park, Maryland, tornado was remarkable because of its long-track that passed within a close range of two Doppler radars. This tornado featured many similarities to previous significant tornado events that resulted in widespread damage in urban areas, such as the Oklahoma City tornado of 3 May 1999. The College Park tornado was the third in a series of three tornadoes associated with a supercell storm that developed over central Virginia. This paper presents a synoptic and mesoscale overview of favorable conditions and forcing mechanisms that resulted in the severe convective outbreak associated with the College Park tornado. Convective morphology will be examined in terms of Doppler radar and satellite imagery. This study concludes with a discussion of the effectiveness of using MM5 guidance in conjunction with satellite and radar imagery in the operational environment of forecasting severe convection.",physics

  Boosted Decision Trees","In this paper, we compare the performance, stability and robustness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) using MiniBooNE Monte Carlo samples. These methods attempt to classify events given a number of identification variables. The BDT algorithm has been discussed by us in previous publications. Testing is done in this paper by smearing and shifting the input variables of testing samples. Based on these studies, BDT has better particle identification performance than ANN. The degradation of the classifications obtained by shifting or smearing variables of testing results is smaller for BDT than for ANN.",physics
610,"Does Confinement Force Marriage between Two Unwilling Partners?: A Case
  Study of He2@BmNm (m=12, 16)","TThe stability of Ngn@B12N12 and Ngn@B16N16 systems is assessed through a density functional study and ab initio simulation. Although they are found to be thermodynamically unstable with respect to the dissociation of individual Ng atoms and parent cage, ab initio simulation reveals that except Ne2@B12N12 they are kinetically stable to retain their structures intact throughout the simulation time (500 fs). The Ne2@B12N12 cage dissociates and the Ne atoms get separated as the simulation proceeds. The He-He unit undergoes translation, rotation and vibration inside the cavity of B12N12 and B16N16 cages. Electron density analysis (Atoms-in-Molecule (AIM)) shows that there is some degree of covalent character in He-He bond (Wc type) of He2@B12N12. In case of He2@B16N16, the He-He interaction is mostly of noncovalent type (Wn). In many cases, especially for the heavier Ng atoms the Ng-N/B bonds are found to be of covalent type or at least having some degree of covalent character. But Wiberg bond indices show zero bond order in He-He bond and very low bond order in cases of Ng-N/B bonds. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) provides further insights into the bonding among the Ng atoms and the cage. The change in charge distribution, radius, hardness, electrophilicity and polarizability implies that they possess different properties and reactivity from their parent moieties. The HOMO energies of He2 units in He2@B12N12 and He2@B16N16 are significantly higher than that in free He atoms. Their kinetic stability and different calculated properties imply that the He-He interaction and Ng-N/B interaction may be considered as chemical bonds according to the IUPAC definition.",physics

  3) Drive Beam","For the CLIC two-beam scheme, a high-current, long-pulse drive beam is required for RF power generation. Taking advantage of the 3 GHz klystrons available at the LEP injector once LEP stops, a 180 MeV electron accelerator is being constructed for a nominal beam current of 3.5 A and 1.5 microsecond pulse length. The high current requires highly effective suppression of dipolar wakes. Two concepts are investigated for the accelerating structure design: the ""Tapered Damped Structure"" developed for the CLIC main beam, and the ""Slotted Iris - Constant Aperture"" structure. Both use 4 SiC loads per cell for effective higher-order mode damping. A full-size prototype of the TDS structure has been built and tested successfully at full power. A first prototype of the SICA structure is being built.",physics

The system is composed of a quartz bulk acoustic wave resonator placed inside a microwave re-entrant cavity, which is designed to act as both the electrodes for piezoelectric actuation as well as a 3D resonator. The cavity electromagnetic mode is modulated by a 5 MHz bulk acoustic wave shear mode, which is modeled and experimentally verified using the input-output formalism.

618,Classifying orbits in the restricted three-body problem,"The case of the planar circular restricted three-body problem is used as a test field in order to determine the character of the orbits of a small body which moves under the gravitational influence of the two heavy primary bodies. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis on the phase space mixing by classifying initial conditions of orbits and distinguishing between three types of motion: (i) bounded, (ii) escape and (iii) collisional. The presented outcomes reveal the high complexity of this dynamical system. Furthermore, our numerical analysis shows a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along all the escape regimes. Interpreting the collisional motion as leaking in the phase space we related our results to both chaotic scattering and the theory of leaking Hamiltonian systems. We also determined the escape and collisional basins and computed the corresponding escape/collisional times. We hope our contribution to be useful for a further understanding of the escape and collisional mechanism of orbits in the restricted three-body problem.",physics

The validity of the approach is confirmed by extensive comparisons with numerical TCAD simulations in all regions of operation from deep depletion to accumulation and linear to saturation.",physics

  incompressible flows","A recent study on axisymmetric ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibria with incompressible flows [H. Tasso and G. N. Throumoulopoulos, Phys. Plasmas {\bf 5}, 2378 (1998)] is extended to the generic case of helically symmetric equilibria with incompressible flows. It is shown that the equilibrium states of the system under consideration are governed by an elliptic partial differential equation for the helical magnetic flux function $\psi$ containing five surface quantities along with a relation for the pressure. The above mentioned equation can be transformed to one possessing differential part identical in form to the corresponding static equilibrium equation, which is amenable to several classes of analytic solutions. In particular, equilibria with electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces and non-constant-Mach-number flows are constructed. Unlike the case in axisymmetric equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces, helically symmetric $T=T(\psi)$ equilibria are over-determined, i.e., in this case the equilibrium equations reduce to a set of eight ordinary differential equations with seven surface quantities. In addition, it is proved the non-existence of incompressible helically symmetric equilibria with (a) purely helical flows (b) non-parallel flows with isothermal magnetic surfaces and the magnetic field modulus being a surface quantity (omnigenous equilibria).",physics
622,"Developing and Researching PhET simulations for Teaching Quantum
  Mechanics","Quantum mechanics is difficult to learn because it is counterintuitive, hard to visualize, mathematically challenging, and abstract. The Physics Education Technology (PhET) Project, known for its interactive computer simulations for teaching and learning physics, now includes 18 simulations on quantum mechanics designed to improve learning of this difficult subject. Our simulations include several key features to help students build mental models and intuitions about quantum mechanics: visual representations of abstract concepts and microscopic processes that cannot be directly observed, interactive environments that directly couple students' actions to animations, connections to everyday life, and efficient calculations so students can focus on the concepts rather than the math. Like all PhET simulations, these are developed using the results of education research and feedback from educators, and are tested in student interviews and classroom studies. This article provides an overview of the PhET quantum simulations and their development. We also describe research demonstrating their effectiveness and share some insights about student thinking that we have gained from our research on quantum simulations.",physics

  Lipid-Raft Phase Boundaries Depend on Sample-Prep Procedure?","For some time now, we have been using a FRET-based strategy to make high-resolution studies of phase behavior in ternary lipid-raft membrane mixtures. Our FRET experiments can be carried out on ordinary, polydisperse multilamellar vesicle suspensions, so we are able to prepare our samples according to a procedure that was designed specifically to guard against artifactual phase separation. In some respects (i.e., the number and nature of two-phase regions observed), our phase diagrams are consistent with previously published reports. However, in other respects (i.e., overall size of miscibility gaps, phase boundary locations and their dependence on temperature) there are clear differences. Here we present FRET data taken in DOPC/DPPC/Cholesterol mixtures at 25.0, 35.0 and 45.0oC. Comparisons between our results and previously reported phase boundaries suggest that lipid-raft mixtures may be particularly susceptible to demixing effects during sample preparation.",physics
624,"A finite element study of the influence of the osteotomy surface on the
  backward displacement during exophthalmia reduction","Exophthalmia is characterized by a protrusion of the eyeball. The most frequent surgery consists in an osteotomy of the orbit walls to increase the orbital volume and to retrieve a normal eye position. Only a few clinical obser-vations have estimated the relationship between the eyeball backward dis-placement and the decompressed fat tissue volume. This paper presents a method to determine the relationship between the eyeball backward displace-ment and the osteotomy surface made by the surgeon, in order to improve ex-ophthalmia reduction planning. A poroelastic finite element model involving morphology, material properties of orbital components, and surgical gesture is proposed to perform this study on 12 patients. As a result, the osteotomy sur-face seems to have a non-linear influence on the backward displacement. More-over, the FE model permits to give a first estimation of an average law linking those two parameters. This law may be helpful in a surgical planning frame-work.",physics

After the elimination of singular terms associated with the Fermi resonance, amplitude equations to describe the slow dynamics of vibrational energy transfer are derived, which recover the result obtained by a technique developed in nonlinear optics [S.J.

  sustainability transitions policy","This article proposes a fundamental methodological shift in the modelling of policy interventions for sustainability transitions in order to account for complexity (e.g. self-reinforcing mechanism arising from multi-agent interactions) and agent heterogeneity (e.g. differences in consumer and investment behaviour). We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate policy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then identify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches most frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative, optimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the full-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual influences among agents and capture related self-reinforcing (positive feedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and path-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent heterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling approach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its use in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption and diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3) interactions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and (4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the proposed methodology is discussed by reference to four applications: the diffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on income and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the cross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. The article calls for a fundamental methodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with that of the climatic system, for a combined and realistic understanding of the impact of sustainability policies.",physics
628,"Remarkable Hydrogen Storage on Beryllium Oxide Clusters: First
  Principles Calculations","Since the current transportation sector is the largest consumer of oil, and subsequently responsible for major air pollutants, it is inevitable to use alternative renewable sources of energies for vehicular applications. The hydrogen energy seems to be a promising candidate. To explore the possibility of achieving a solid-state high-capacity storage of hydrogen for onboard applications, we have performed first principles density functional theoretical calculations of hydrogen storage properties of beryllium oxide clusters (BeO)$_{n}$ (n=2 -- 8). We observed that polar BeO bond is responsible for H$_{2}$ adsorption. The problem of cohesion of beryllium atoms does not arise, as they are an integral part of BeO clusters. The (BeO)$_{n}$ (n=2 -- 8) adsorbs 8--12 H$_{2}$ molecules with an adsorption energy in the desirable range of reversible hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of H$_{2}$ adsorbed on BeO clusters meets the ultimate 7.5 wt% limit, recommended for onboard practical applications.   In conclusion, beryllium oxide clusters exhibit a remarkable solid-state hydrogen storage.",physics
629,Quantum mechanics can be led by metrics in Minkowski's time-space world,"A body of theory is completely different between relativity theory and quantum mechanics. Most targeting physical phenomena are different between them as well. Despite that both theories describe our time-space world, no one has succeeded in arriving at one of these theories by using the other one, deductively. Fusion of these two theories produced quantum field theory. However this theory impresses us as a theory that was made by merging the two theories by force. So this theory cannot indicate the reason why both relativity theory and quantum mechanics exist in this world at the same time. Here I show you that quantum mechanics can be led by the equation of Minkowski's metrics, which stands up in the relativistic world of space and time. This is the first report proving mathematically that quantum mechanics can be born reductively in our relativistic world.",physics

  Communities","Complex networks emerge under different conditions through simple rules of growth and evolution. Such rules are typically local when dealing with biological systems and most social webs. An important deviation from such scenario is provided by communities of agents engaged in technology development, such as open source (OS) communities. Here we analyze their network structure, showing that it defines a complex weighted network with scaling laws at different levels, as measured by looking at e-mail exchanges. We also present a simple model of network growth involving non-local rules based on betweenness centrality. The model outcomes fit very well the observed scaling laws, suggesting that the overall goals of the community and the underlying hierarchical organization play a key role is shaping its dynamics.",physics

We conclude that the magnetosphere self-organizes globally during substorms, but neither the magnetosphere nor the solar wind become more predictable in the course of a substorm. This conclusion is based on analysis of five hundred substorms in the period from 2000 to 2002. A minimal dynamic-stochastic model of the driven magnetosphere that reproduces many statistical features of substorm indices is discussed.",physics
634,Velocity and Pressure Fields Induced by Spheres in an Unbounded Fluid,"We propose a procedure for the determination of the time-dependent velocity and pressure fields of an unbounded incompressible viscous fluid in an external force field induced by an arbitrary number of spheres moving and rotating in it as well as the forces and torques exerted by the fluid on the particles. Within the completely linearized scheme, we express the velocity and pressure fields of the fluid in terms of induced surface force densities and derive the explicit form for all quantities contained in these relations not imposing any additional restrictions on the size of particles, distances between them, and the frequency range. We show the incorrectness of similar results obtained earlier by several authors because these results are expressed in terms of nonexistent inverse tensors. We explain the reasons leading to this and propose a procedure for the elimination of divergent quantities. In the stationary case, using the proposed procedure, we obtained the translational, rotational, and coupled friction and mobility tensors for a system containing an arbitrary number of spheres up to, respectively, the second, forth, and third orders in the dimensionless parameter equal to the ratio of a typical radius of a sphere to a typical distance between two spheres. In various particular cases, the results obtained in the present paper agree with the well-known results derived by other methods.",physics

636,"Modeling of Cables with High and Low Tension Zones using a Hybrid
  Rod-Catenary Formulation","Cables under very low tension may become highly contorted and form loops, tangles, knots and kinks. These nonlinear deformations, which are dominated by flexure and torsion, pose serious concerns for cable deployment. Simulation of the three-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of loop and tangle formation requires a 12th order rod model and the computational effort increases rapidly with increasing cable length and integration time. However, marine cable applications which result in local zones of low-tension very frequently involve large zones of high-tension where the effects of flexure and torsion are insignificant. Simulation of the three-dimensional dynamics of high-tension cables requires only a 6th order catenary model which significantly reduces computational effort relative to a rod model. We propose herein a hybrid computational cable model that employs computationally efficient catenary elements in high-tension zones and rod elements in localized low-tension zones to capture flexure and torsion precisely where needed.",physics

  tactics at start of high level competitions","This paper is focalized on the limit application of judo throws, by tactics at first contact time, with some astonishing information at a first seeing, but biomechanically grounded, not often applied or because against the sound common sense or out the old oral judo tradition. To do so we provide an appraisal of the grips concept and his consequences in the Olympic sport judo from a biomechanics perspective, we will try to deeper both the concept and the function of grips and define the potential application of some throws without grips. Broadening this situation we try to underline some specific throwing situation in which grips are or not at all applied or applied in non conventional way. We describe at first the problem from the theoretical point of view. And as second point we try to find practical application, original or already developed in high level competitions. The provocative words Judo without grips or throw without grips are connected to the limit application of some biomechanical tricks, grounded on two well known physical principles: the time advance in the attack, in Japanese Sen no Sen (already applied in real competitions), and the utilization of the own inertia connected to high attack speed to apply in totally original way one of the two biomechanical tools utilized to throw the human body.",physics
638,"Generation-by-Generation Dissection of the Response Function in Long
  Memory Epidemic Processes","In a number of natural and social systems, the response to an exogenous shock relaxes back to the average level according to a long-memory kernel $\sim 1/t^{1+\theta}$ with $0 \leq \theta <1$. In the presence of an epidemic-like process of triggered shocks developing in a cascade of generations at or close to criticality, this ""bare"" kernel is renormalized into an even slower decaying response function $\sim 1/t^{1-\theta}$. Surprisingly, this means that the shorter the memory of the bare kernel (the larger $1+\theta$), the longer the memory of the response function (the smaller $1-\theta$). Here, we present a detailed investigation of this paradoxical behavior based on a generation-by-generation decomposition of the total response function, the use of Laplace transforms and of ""anomalous"" scaling arguments. The paradox is explained by the fact that the number of triggered generations grows anomalously with time at $\sim t^\theta$ so that the contributions of active generations up to time $t$ more than compensate the shorter memory associated with a larger exponent $\theta$. This anomalous scaling results fundamentally from the property that the expected waiting time is infinite for $0 \leq \theta \leq 1$. The techniques developed here are also applied to the case $\theta >1$ and we find in this case that the total renormalized response is a {\bf constant} for $t < 1/(1-n)$ followed by a cross-over to $\sim 1/t^{1+\theta}$ for $t \gg 1/(1-n)$.",physics
639,Improved orbit predictions using two-line elements,"The density of orbital space debris constitutes an increasing environmental challenge. There are three ways to alleviate the problem: debris mitigation, debris removal and collision avoidance. This paper addresses collision avoidance, by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite increase in orbit prediction accuracy. Batch least-squares differential correction is applied to the publicly available two-line element (TLE) catalog of space objects. Using a high-precision numerical propagator, we fit an orbit to state vectors derived from successive TLEs. We then propagate the fitted orbit further forward in time. These predictions are compared to precision ephemeris data derived from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) for several satellites, including objects in the congested sun-synchronous orbital region. The method leads to a predicted range error that increases at a typical rate of 100 meters per day, approximately a 10-fold improvement over TLE's propagated with their associated analytic propagator (SGP4). Corresponding improvements for debris trajectories could potentially provide initial conjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable collision avoidance system.   We discuss additional optimization and the computational requirements for applying all-on-all conjunction analysis to the whole TLE catalog, present and near future. Finally, we outline a scheme for debris-debris collision avoidance that may become practicable given these developments.",physics

643,The Reasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Physical Sciences,"Mathematics and its relation to the physical universe have been the topic of speculation since the days of Pythagoras. Several different views of the nature of mathematics have been considered: Realism - mathematics exists and is discovered; Logicism - all mathematics may be deduced through pure logic; Formalism - mathematics is just the manipulation of formulas and rules invented for the purpose; Intuitionism - mathematics comprises mental constructs governed by self evident rules. The debate among the several schools has major importance in understanding what Eugene Wigner called, ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences."" In return, this `Unreasonable Effectiveness' suggests a possible resolution of the debate in favor of it Realism. The crucial element is the extraordinary predictive capacity of mathematical structures descriptive of physical theories.",physics
644,Music in Terms of Science,"To many people, music is a mystery. It is uniquely human, because no other species produces elaborate, well organized sound for no particular reason. It has been part of every known civilization on earth. It has become a very part of man's need to impose his will upon the universe, to bring order out of chaos and to endow his moments of highest awareness with enduring form and substance. It is a form of art dealing with the organization of tones into patterns.   Despite of cultural differences, music from different civilizations seems to consist of some building blocks that are universal: melody, harmony, rhythm, etc. Almost all musical systems are based on scales spanning an octave---the note that sounds the same as the one you started off with, but at a higher or lower pitch. It was discovered by Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher who lived around 500 BC, that the note an octave higher than another has a frequency twice high. The notes that sound harmonious together have simple rational number ratios between their frequencies.   It is those implicit structures and relationships in apparently mysterious musical experience that I am interested in exploring here. As a scientist by training with a consistent passion for classical guitar playing, I would like make an attempt to explain the musical experience in terms of science and mathematics, hoping to fill some gaps between the knowledge of scientists and artistic intuition of musicians.",physics

  Medical Image Processing","We report the development of a scalar quantization approach that helps build tables of decision and reconstruction levels for any probability density function (pdf). Several example pdf's are used for illustration:   Uniform, Gaussian, Laplace, one-sided Rayleigh, and Gamma (One sided and double-sided symmetrical). The main applications of the methodology are principally aimed at Multiresolution Image compression where generally the Stretched Exponential pdf is encountered. Specialising to this important case, we perform quantization and information entropy calculations from selected medical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) pictures of the human brain. The image histograms are fitted to a Stretched exponential model and the corresponding entropies are compared.",physics

More specifically, the non-oscillating component of the Fourier spectrum, i.e. the component resulting from the Fourier transform of the electric field evaluated at $\omega=0$, can be associated with the area under a locally unipolar electromagnetic pulse that travels in free space at the speed of light.",physics
647,Davies ENDOR revisited: Enhanced sensitivity and nuclear spin relaxation,"Over the past 50 years, electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) has become a fairly ubiquitous spectroscopic technique, allowing the study of spin transitions for nuclei which are coupled to electron spins. However, the low spin number sensitivity of the technique continues to pose serious limitations. Here we demonstrate that signal intensity in a pulsed Davies ENDOR experiment depends strongly on the nuclear relaxation time T1n, and can be severely reduced for long T1n. We suggest a development of the original Davies ENDOR sequence that overcomes this limitation, thus offering dramatically enhanced signal intensity and spectral resolution. Finally, we observe that the sensitivity of the original Davies method to T1n can be exploited to measure nuclear relaxation, as we demonstrate for phosphorous donors in silicon and for the endohedral fullerene N@C60 in CS2.",physics

The advances in nanotechnology and the potential growth in carbon nanotubes production, in which if control mechanisms not in place for safely disposing off nanotubes, these nanotubes could pose as an environmental pollutant, due to the severe, persistent and bio-accumulative nature of these compounds. Therefore, the need for this scientific research is timely in case of some technological disaster. Besides, the study on interaction of carbon nanotubes with various organic materials provide a new knowledge and opportunities for potential application of the nanotubes.",physics
650,Energy harvesters for space,"Energy harvesting is the fundamental activity in almost all forms of space exploration known to humans. So far, in most cases, it is not feasible to bring, along with probe, spacecraft or rover suitable supply of fuel to cover all mission's energy needs. Some concepts of mining or other form of manufacturing of fuel on exploration site have been made, but they still base either on some facility that needs one mean of energy to generate fuel, perhaps of better quality, or needs some initial energy to be harvested to start a self sustaining cycle. Following paper summarizes key factors that determine satellite energy needs, and explains some either most widespread or most interesting examples of energy harvesting devices, present in Earth orbit as well as exploring Solar System and, very recently, beyond. Some of presented energy harvester are suitable for very large (in terms of size and functionality) probes, other fit and scale easily on satellites ranging from dozens of tons to few grams.",physics
651,"Mesoscopic effective material parameters for thin layers modeled as
  single and double grids of interacting loaded wires","As an example of thin composite layers we consider single and double grids of periodically arranged interacting wires loaded with a certain distributed reactive impedance. Currents induced to the wires by a normally incident plane wave are rigorously calculated and the corresponding dipole moment densities are determined. Using this data and the averaged fields we assign mesoscopic material parameters for the proposed grid structures. These parameters depend on the number of grids, and measure the averaged induced polarizations. It is demonstrated that properly loaded double grids possess polarization response that over some frequency range can be described by assigning negative values for the mesoscopic parameters. Discussion is conducted on the physical meaningfulness to assign such material parameters for thin composite slabs. The results predicted by the proposed method for the double-grid structures are compared with the results obtained using the commonly adopted S-parameter retrieval procedure.",physics
652,1/f fluctuations of DNA temperature at thermal denaturation,"We theoretically investigated the temperature fluctuations of DNA close to denaturation and observed a strong enhancement of these fluctuations at the critical temperature. Although in a much lower frequency range, such a sharp increase was also reported in the recent experimental work of Nagapriya et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 038102 (2006)]. We showed that there is instead no enhancement of temperature fluctuations when the dissipation coefficient in Langevin equations is assumed to be larger than a few tens of ps-1, and pointed out the possible role of the solvent in real experiments. We sought for a possible correlation between the growth of large bubbles and the enhancement of temperature fluctuations but found no direct evidence thereof. Finally, we showed that neither the enhancement of fluctuations nor the 1/f dependence are observed at the scale of a single base pair, while these properties show up when summing the contributions of a large number of base pairs. We therefore conclude that both effects result from collective motions that are facilitated by the divergence of the correlation length at denaturation.",physics
653,"A Contour-Guided Deformable Image Registration Algorithm for Adaptive
  Radiotherapy","In adaptive radiotherapy, deformable image registration is often conducted between the planning CT and treatment CT (or cone beam CT) to generate a deformation vector field (DVF) for dose accumulation and contour propagation. The auto propagated contours on the treatment CT may contain relatively large errors, especially in low contrast regions. A clinician inspection and editing of the propagated contours are frequently needed. The edited contours are able to meet the clinical requirement for adaptive therapy; however, the DVF is still inaccurate and inconsistent with the edited contours. The purpose of this work is to develop a contour-guided deformable image registration (CG-DIR) algorithm to improve the accuracy and consistency of the DVF for adaptive radiotherapy. Incorporation of the edited contours into the registration algorithm is realized by regularizing the objective function of the original demons algorithm with a term of intensity matching between the delineated structures set pairs. The CG-DIR algorithm is implemented on computer graphics processing units (GPUs) by following the original GPU-based demons algorithm computation framework [Gu et al, Phys Med Biol. 55(1): 207-219, 2010]. The performance of CG-DIR is evaluated on five clinical head-and-neck and one pelvic cancer patient data. It is found that compared with the original demons, CG-DIR improves the accuracy and consistency of the DVF, while retaining similar high computational efficiency.",physics
654,Reichenbach's Transcendental Probability,"The aim of this article is twofold. First, we shall review and analyse the Neo-Kantian justification for the application of probabilistic concepts in physics that was defended by Hans Reichenbach early in his career, notably in his dissertation of 1916. At first sight this Kantian approach seems to contrast sharply with Reichenbach's later logical positivist, frequentist viewpoint. But, and this is our second goal, we shall attempt to show that there is an underlying continuity in Reichenbach's thought: typical features of his early Kantian conceptions can still be recognized in his later work.",physics

657,Remarks on the Origin of Path Integration: Einstein and Feynman,"I offer some historical comments about the origins of Feynman's path integral approach, as an alternative approach to standard quantum mechanics. Looking at the interaction between Einstein and Feynman, which was mediated by Feynman's thesis supervisor John Wheeler, it is argued that, contrary to what one might expect, the significance of the interaction between Einstein and Feynman pertained to a critique of classical field theory, rather than to a direct critique of quantum mechanics itself. Nevertheless, the critical perspective on classical field theory became a motivation and point of departure for Feynman's space-time approach to non-relativistic quantum mechanics.",physics
658,Theoretical investigation of finite size effects at DNA melting,"We investigated how the finiteness of the length of the sequence affects the phase transition that takes place at DNA melting temperature. For this purpose, we modified the Transfer Integral method to adapt it to the calculation of both extensive (partition function, entropy, specific heat, etc) and non-extensive (order parameter and correlation length) thermodynamic quantities of finite sequences with open boundary conditions, and applied the modified procedure to two different dynamical models. We showed that rounding of the transition clearly takes place when the length of the sequence is decreased. We also performed a finite-size scaling analysis of the two models and showed that the singular part of the free energy can indeed be expressed in terms of an homogeneous function. However, both the correlation length and the average separation between paired bases diverge at the melting transition, so that it is no longer clear to which of these two quantities the length of the system should be compared. Moreover, Josephson's identity is satisfied for none of the investigated models, so that the derivation of the characteristic exponents which appear, for example, in the expression of the specific heat, requires some care.",physics
659,Statistical anisotropy of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,"Direct numerical simulations of decaying and forced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence without and with mean magnetic field are analyzed by higher-order two-point statistics. The turbulence exhibits statistical anisotropy with respect to the direction of the local magnetic field even in the case of global isotropy. A mean magnetic field reduces the parallel-field dynamics while in the perpendicular direction a gradual transition towards two-dimensional MHD turbulence is observed with $k^{-3/2}$ inertial-range scaling of the perpendicular energy spectrum. An intermittency model based on the Log-Poisson approach, $\zeta_p=p/g^2 +1 -(1/g)^{p/g}$, is able to describe the observed structure function scalings.",physics

661,"The Architecture of Idiotypic Networks: Percolation and Scaling
  Behaviour","We investigate a model where idiotypes (characterizing B-lymphocytes and antibodies of an immune system) and anti-idiotypes are represented by complementary bitstrings of a given length d allowing for a number of mismatches (matching rules). In this model, the vertices of the hypercube in dimension d represent the potential repertoire of idiotypes. A random set of (with probability p) occupied vertices corresponds to the expressed repertoire of idiotypes at a given moment. Vertices of this set linked by the above matching rules build random clusters. We give a structural and statistical characterisation of these clusters - or in other words - of the architecture of the idiotypic network. Increasing the probability p one finds at a critical p a percolation transition where for the first time a large connected graph occures with probability one. Increasing p further, there is a second transition above which the repertoire is complete in the sense that any newly introduced idiotype finds a complementary anti-idiotype. We introduce structural characteristics such as the mass distributions and the fragmentation rate for random clusters, and determine the scaling behaviour of the cluster size distribution near the percolation transition, including finite size corrections. We find that slightly above the percolation transition the large connected cluster (the central part of the idiotypic network) consists typically of one highly connected part and a number of weakly connected constituents and coexists with a number of small, isolated clusters. This is in accordance with the picture of a central and a peripheral part of the idiotypic network and gives some support to idealized architectures of the central part used in recent dynamical mean field models.",physics
662,Swinging of red blood cells under shear flow,"We reveal that under moderate shear stress (of the order of 0.1 Pa) red blood cells present an oscillation of their inclination (swinging) superimposed to the long-observed steady tanktreading (TT) motion. A model based on a fluid ellipsoid surrounded by a visco-elastic membrane initially unstrained (shape memory) predicts all observed features of the motion: an increase of both swinging amplitude and period (1/2 the TT period) upon decreasing the shear stress, a shear stress-triggered transition towards a narrow shear stress-range intermittent regime of successive swinging and tumbling, and a pure tumbling motion at lower shear stress-values.",physics
663,Dynamic Behaviors of Mix-game Model and Its Applications,"This paper proposes a modification to Minority Game (MG) by adding some agents who play majority game into MG. So it is referred to as mix-game. The highlight of this model is that the two groups of agents in mix-game have different bounded abilities to deal with history information and to count their own performance. Through simulations, this paper finds out that the local volatilities change a lot by adding some agents who play majority game into MG, and the change of local volatilities largely depends on different combinations of history memories of the two groups. Furthermore this paper analyses the underlying mechanisms for this finding. It also gives an example of applications of mix-game.",physics

665,On the Conservation of Physical Quantities,"Certain transformations of isolated physical systems underlying various conservation laws in physics are noted. As regards each of these transformations, there is a theoretical action that is equivalent to a matched physical action on the system. Evidence supporting this thesis is found in experimental psychological research where results of various experiments allow that the imagined rotation of an object is analogous to a physical rotation. The conservation laws based on the transformations noted are theoretical or mental in nature to the same extent that they are physical. When one of the conservation principles noted is tested by carrying out the relevant transformation on the system, this test is essentially one of the influence of mental activity on physical reality.",physics

These noises are both a nuisance and a peculiarity of several physical systems; in dielectrics, glasses and networked liquids it is very common to study this noise to gather useful information. Sometimes it happens that the noise has a power-law shape only in a certain frequency range, and contains other important features, that are however difficult to study because simple fits often fail. Here I propose a model-based fit procedure that performs well on spectra obtained in a molecular dynamics simulation.",physics

This is a non-usual point of view in hydrodynamics courses and our aim is to fix ideas about the intrinsic information contained in the matching conditions, on fluids in this case. Afterward, it is analyzed the polarization of the normal modes at the interface and it is shown that this information can be achieved through a physical analysis and reinforced later by the matching conditions. A detailed analysis of the matching conditions is given to understand the role that plays the continuity of the stress tensor through the interface on the physics of the surface particle movement. The main importance of the viscosity of each medium is deduced.",physics

  water studied with Geant4","A Geant4-based Monte Carlo model for Heavy-Ion Therapy (MCHIT) is used to study radiation fields of H-1, He-4, Li-7 and C-12 beams with similar ranges (~160-180 mm) in water. Microdosimetry spectra are simulated for wall-less and walled Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPCs) placed outside or inside a phantom, as in experiments performed, respectively, at NIRS, Japan and GSI, Germany. The impact of fragmentation reactions on microdosimetry spectra is investigated for He-4, Li-7 and C-12, and contributions from nuclear fragments of different charge are evaluated for various TEPC positions in the phantom. The microdosimetry spectra measured on the beam axis are well described by MCHIT, in particular, in the vicinity of the Bragg peak. However, the simulated spectra for the walled TEPC far from the beam axis are underestimated. Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) of the considered beams is estimated using a modified microdosimetric-kinetic model. Calculations show a similar rise of the RBE up to 2.2-2.9 close to the Bragg peak for helium, lithium and carbon beams compared to the modest values of 1-1.2 at the plateau region. Our results suggest that helium and lithium beams are also promising options for cancer therapy.",physics

The two-dimensional nonlinear equation for potential valid for small values of that is obtained and solved by the separation of variables. Solutions in the form of cnoidal waves,existing behind the moving bunch at small values of vertical coordinate,are obtained.In particular,at some boundary conditions,corresponding to blow-out regime in the underdense plasma,the solution represents by a solitary nonlinear wave.   Approximate solution is also obtained using the method of multiple sacales.   The indications are obtained that the dependense of the amplitudes on longitudinal coordinate determines essentially,even in the first approximation,by driving bunch charge distribution.The wake wave amplitude can increase at some conditions along the longitudinal distance from the rear part of the bunch.",physics
672,Density-Driven Compactional Flow in Porous Media,"In the mathematical modelling of compactional flow in porous media, the constitutive relation is typically modelled in terms of a nonlinear relationship between effective pressure and porosity, and compaction is essentially poroelastic. However, at depths deeper than 1 km where pressure is high, compaction becomes more akin to a viscous one. Two mathematical models of compaction in porous media are formulated and the noninear equations are then solved numerically. The essential features of numerical profiles of poroelastic and viscous compaction are thus compared with asymptotic solutions. Two distinguished styles of density-driven compaction in fast and slow compacting sediments are analysed and shown in this paper.",physics
673,"Transport and entry of plasma clouds/jets across transverse magnetic
  discontinuities: Three-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell
  simulations","In this paper we use three-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the interaction of a small-Larmor radius plasma cloud/jet with a transverse non-uniform magnetic field typical to a tangential discontinuity in a parallel geometry. The simulation setup corresponds to an idealized, yet relevant, magnetospheric configuration likely to be observed at the magnetopause during northward orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field. The numerical simulations are adapted to study the kinetic effects and their role on the transport and entry of localized plasma jets similar to those identified inside the Earth's magnetosheath propagating towards the magnetopause. The simulations reveal the formation of a polarization electric field inside the main bulk of the plasma cloud that enables its forward transport and entry across the transverse magnetic field. The jet is able to penetrate the transition region when the height of the magnetic barrier does not exceed a certain critical threshold. Otherwise, the forward transport along the injection direction is stopped before full penetration of the magnetopause. Moreover, the jet is pushed back and simultaneously deflected in the perpendicular plane to the magnetic field. Our simulations evidence physical processes advocated previously by the theoretical model of impulsive penetration and revealed in laboratory experiments.",physics
674,Effect of citation patterns on network structure,"We propose a model for an evolving citation network that incorporates the citation pattern followed in a particular discipline. We define the citation pattern in a discipline by three factors. The average number of references per article, the probability of citing an article based on its age and the number of citations it already has. We also consider the average number of articles published per year in the discipline. We propose that the probability of citing an article based on its age can be modeled by a lifetime distribution. The lifetime distribution models the citation lifetime of an average article in a particular discipline. We find that the citation lifetime distribution in a particular discipline predicts the topological structure of the citation network in that discipline. We show that the power law exponent depends on the three factors that define the citation pattern. Finally we fit the data from the Physical Review D journal to obtain the citation pattern and calculate the total degree distribution for the citation network.",physics

  Flat-panel multi-anode PMTs (Hamamatsu H8500)","A proximity focusing ring imaging Cherenkov detector using aerogel as the radiator has been studied for an upgrade of the Belle detector at the KEK-B-factory. We constructed a prototype Cherenkov counter using a 4 x 4 array of 64-channel flat-panel multi-anode PMTs (Hamamatsu H8500) with a large effective area. The aerogel samples were made with a new technique to obtain a higher transmission length at a high refractive index (n=1.05). Multi-channel PMTs are read-out with analog memory chips. The detector was tested at the KEK-PS pi2 beam line in November, 2002. To evaluate systematically the performance of the detector, tests were carried out with various aerogel samples using pion beams with momenta between 0.5 GeV/c and 4 GeV/c. The typical angular resolution was around 14 mrad, and the average number of detected photoelectrons was around 6. We expect that pions and kaons can be separated at a 4 sigma level at 4 GeV/c.",physics
676,Lattice Matching with a Quadrupole Missing,"The lattice for the present design of the TESLA Linear Collider with integrated X-Ray Laser Facility is basically a FODO structure with constant beta-function. There are more than 800 individually powered superconducting quadrupoles to focus the beam in the two main linear accelerators (each with a length of 15 km). For the availability of the beams it is important that a power supply failure or even a magnet failure does not cause a significant down time of the linac. It is demonstrated that the beta-function can be matched with a quadrupole ""missing"". One part of the main linac (up-to 50 GeV) will be used to accelerate the High Energy Physics beam and the Free Electron Laser drive beam with different accelerating gradients. Therefore the betatron phase advance will be 60 deg. or 90 deg. depending on the beam energy. It is shown that even in that case it is possible to match the lattice simultaneously for both beams with a quadrupole missing.",physics
677,"2D ground motion at a soft viscoelastic layer/hard substratum site in
  response to SH cylindrical seismic waves radiated by deep and shallow line
  sources","We show, essentially by theoretical means, that for a site with the chosen simple geometry and mechanical properties (horizontal, homogeneous, soft viscoelastic layer of infinite lateral extent overlying, and in welded contact with, a homogeneous, hard elastic substratum of half-infinite radial extent, shear-horizontal motion): 1) coupling to Love modes is all the weaker the farther the seismic source (modeled as a line, assumed to lie in the substratum) is from the lower boundary of the soft layer, 2) for a line source close to the lower boundary of the soft layer, the ground response is characterized by possible beating phenomena, and is of significantly-longer duration than for excitation by cylindrical waves radiated by deep sources. Numerical applications of the theory show, for instance, that a line source, located 40m below the lower boundary of a 60m thick soft layer in a hypothetical Mexico City-like site, radiating a SH pulse of 4s duration, produces substantial ground motion during 200s, with marked beating, at an epicentral distance of 3km. This response is in some respects similar to that observed in real cities located at soft-soil sites so that the model employed herein may help to establish the causes and pinpoint the major contributing factors of the devastating effects of earthquakes in such cities.",physics

Data from this equipment as well as high precision direct current measurement provide the hard data for the Bunch Injection Controller. A large number of parameters determined by injection design considerations as well as set by operators for different circumstances are also used by the software algorithms to determine the desired bucket injection order and charge quantity for each injection pulse. These requests are then passed on to the venerable SLAC master pattern generator, which provides beams for other applications as well. This highly visible and highly successful system is implemented using the EPICS toolkit, and fits well into the merged SLAC EPICS/SLC control system.

Various plausible small-scale defects do not suffice to bring the failure stresses into agreement with available experimental results. As in the experiments, the fracture of carbon nanotubes is predicted to be brittle. The results show moderate dependence of fracture strength on chirality.",physics

687,Stochastic Opinion Formation in Scale-Free Networks,"The dynamics of opinion formation in large groups of people is a complex non-linear phenomenon whose investigation is just at the beginning. Both collective behaviour and personal view play an important role in this mechanism. In the present work we mimic the dynamics of opinion formation of a group of agents, represented by two state $\pm 1$, as a stochastic response of each of them to the opinion of his/her neighbours in the social network and to feedback from the average opinion of the whole. In the light of recent studies, a scale-free Barab\'asi-Albert network has been selected to simulate the topology of the interactions. A turbulent-like dynamics, characterized by an intermittent behaviour, is observed for a certain range of the model parameters. The problem of uncertainty in decision taking is also addressed both from a topological point of view, using random and targeted removal of agents from the network, and by implementing a three state model, where the third state, zero, is related to the information available to each agent. Finally, the results of the model are tested against the best known network of social interactions: the stock market. A time series of daily closures of the Dow Jones index has been used as an indicator of the possible applicability of our model in the financial context. Good qualitative agreement is found.",physics
688,Beam Diagnostics Systems For The National Ignition Facility,"The National Ignition Facility laser focuses 1.8 Mega-joules of ultraviolet light (wavelength 351 nano-meters) from 192 beams into a 600-micro-meter-diameter volume. Effective use of this output in target experiments requires that the power output from all the beams match within 8% over their entire 20-nanosecond waveform. The scope of NIF beam diagnostics systems necessary to accomplish this task is unprecedented for laser facilities. Each beam line contains 110 major optical components distributed over a 510 meter path, and diagnostic tolerances for beam measurement are demanding. Total laser pulse energy is measured with 2.8% precision, and the inter-beam temporal variation of pulse power is measured with 4% precision. These measurement goals are achieved through use of approximately 160 sensor packages that measure the energy at five locations and power at 3 locations along each beamline using 335 photodiodes, 215 calorimeters and 36 digitizers. Successful operation of such a system requires a high level of automation of the widely distributed sensors. Computer control systems provide the basis for operating the shot diagnostics with repeatable accuracy, assisted by operators who oversee system activities and setup, respond to performance exceptions, and complete calibration and maintenance tasks.",physics

692,Production of a large diameter ECR plasma for plasma processing,"A large diameter plasma over 300 mm in diameter is produced by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) discharges using a newly developed large diameter chamber of 400 mm in inner diameter. It is found that the electron temperature decreases as nitrogen gas is added to pure argon plasma, which is considered that nitrogen molecules absorb the electron energy into the vibrational energy and lead to the decrease of the electron temperature. Moreover, it is found that the plasma uniformity is improved by adding nitrogen gas, suggesting that the adjunction of nitrogen gas is effective for producing uniform and low electron temperature plasma.",physics

695,Burstiness and Memory in Complex Systems,"The dynamics of a wide range of real systems, from email patterns to earthquakes, display a bursty, intermittent nature, characterized by short timeframes of intensive activity followed by long times of no or reduced activity. The understanding of the origin of such bursty patterns is hindered by the lack of tools to compare different systems using a common framework. We introduce two measures to distinguish the mechanisms responsible for the bursty nature of real signals, changes in the interevent times and memory. We find that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted in both the interevent time distribution and memory, for human dynamics memory is weak, and the bursty character is due to changes in the interevent time distribution. Finally, we show that current models lack in their ability to reproduce the activity pattern observed in real systems, opening up new avenues for future work.",physics
696,Design and Test of a Carbon-Tolerant Alkaline Fuel Cell,"This paper presents new results which may constitute a breakthrough in the effort to develop fuel cells truly suitable for use in cars and trucks. For decades, researchers have known that the alkaline fuel cell (AFC) is much cheaper to make, more efficient and more durable than the more popular PEM fuel cell; however, ""carbon poisoning"" (either from CO2 in air or from contaminants in reformed methanol) causes big problems in the kind of oxygen-hydrogen AFC commonly used in space. This paper reports successful tests of a technique for coating the electrodes with polystyrene which, in conjunction with older common-sense techniques, appears to solve the problem. This kind of design is applicable to cars run on hydrogen fuel, on reformed methanol or even direct methanol. Developing a test methodology was a major part of the work. A foreword by one of the sponsors at NSF discusses the larger importance of this work for energy security and the environment.",physics

  Norwegian Sea and The Barents Sea","A combined high-resolution atmospheric downscaling and wave hindcast based on the ERA-40 reanalysis covering the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea and the Barents Sea is presented. The period covered is from September 1957 to August 2002. The dynamic atmospheric downscaling is performed as a series of short prognostic runs initialized from a blend of ERA-40 and the previous prognostic run to preserve the fine-scale surface features from the high-resolution model while maintaining the large-scale synoptic field from ERA-40. The nested WAM wave model hindcast consists of a coarse 50 km model covering the North Atlantic forced with ERA-40 winds and a nested 10-11 km resolution model forced with downscaled winds.   A comparison against in situ and satellite observations of wind and sea state reveals significant improvement in mean values and upper percentiles of wind vectors and the significant wave height over ERA-40. Improvement is also found in the mean wave period. ERA-40 is biased low in wind speed and significant wave height, a bias which is not reproduced by the downscaling. The atmospheric downscaling also reproduces polar lows, which can not be resolved by ERA-40, but the lows are too weak and short-lived as the downscaling is not capable of capturing their full life cycle.",physics

  undergraduates","At the beginning of academic year 2007-08, staff in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Glasgow started to implement a number of substantial changes to the administration of the level 1 physics undergraduate class. The main aims were to improve the academic performance and progression statistics. With this in mind, a comprehensive system of learning support was introduced, the main remit being the provision of an improved personal contact and academic monitoring and support strategy for all students at level 1. The effects of low engagement with compulsory continuous assessment components had already been observed to have a significant effect for students sitting in the middle of the grade curve. Analysis of data from the 2007-08 class showed that even some nominally high-achieving students achieved lowered grades due to the effects of low engagement. Nonetheless, academic and other support measures put in place during 2007-08 played a part in raising the passrate for the level 1 physics class by approximately 8% as well as raising the progression rate by approximately 10%.",physics

  static target","The variances of matched and sidelobe free mismatched filter estimators are given for arbitrary coherent targets in the case of aperiodic transmission. It is shown that mismatched filtering is often better than matched filtering in terms of estimation accuracy. A search strategy for finding general transmission codes that minimize estimation error and satisfy constraints on code power and amplitude range is then introduced. Results show that nearly perfect codes, with performance close to a single pulse with the same total power can be found. Also, finding these codes is not computationally expensive and such codes can be found for all practical code lengths. The estimation accuracy of the newly found codes are compared to binary phase codes of similar length and found to be better in terms of estimator variance. Similar transmission codes might be worth investigating also for sonar and telecommunications applications.",physics

704,"In-Situ Self-Monitoring of Real-Time Photovoltaic Degradation Only Using
  Maximum Power Point: the Suns-Vmp Method","The uncertainties associated with technology- and geography-specific degradation rates make it difficult to calculate the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and thus the economic viability of solar energy. In this regard, millions of fielded photovoltaic (PV) modules may serve as a global testbed, where we can interpret the routinely collected maximum power point (MPP) time-series data to assess the time-dependent ""health"" thereof. The existing characterization methods, however, cannot effectively mine/decode these datasets to identify various degradation pathways of the corresponding solar modules. In this paper, we propose a new methodology, i.e., the Suns-Vmp method, which offers a simple and powerful approach to monitoring and diagnosing time-dependent degradation of solar modules by physically mining the MPP data. The algorithm reconstructs ""IV"" curves by using the natural illumination- and temperature-dependent daily MPP characteristics as constraints to fit the physics-based compact model. These synthetic IV characteristics are then used to determine the time-dependent evolution of circuit parameters (e.g., series resistance) which in-turn allows one to deduce the dominant degradation mode (e.g., corrosion) for the modules. The proposed method has been applied to analyze the MPP data from a test facility at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Our analysis indicates that the solar modules degraded at a rate of 0.7 %/year due to discoloration and weakened solder bonds. These conclusions are independently validated by outdoor IV measurement and on-site imaging characterization. Integrated with physics-based degradation models or machine learning algorithms, the method can also serve to predict the lifetime of PV systems.",physics
705,The Duality of Nature: Why N Equals 10,"Negative solutions are possible for Einstein's Special Relativity equation, as well as Dirac's, Maxwell's, and Schrodinger's equations; and Schrodinger's equation utilizes antitime to calculate quantum probabilities. Also, since no ground state seems to exist for matter, Dirac predicted that negative matter must exist to keep all of matter from disappearing into negative energy states. And Einstein showed that all things are relative except the speed of light. Together, these imply that 4 negative dimensions (Ds) are overlapped by the 4 positive Ds; that positive and negative matters reside in these 2 separate sets of Ds; and that their separateness prevents their mutual annihilation. Light would then exist as an oscillation of the interface between these 2 sets of Ds, with the 2 relative matters varying equally on each side; thus allowing light to remain constant. And since 2 negatives make a positive, the 2 sets would move as one, even though they are opposites. This means that the 2 sets always remain exactly overlapped; and so, the negative Ds remain disguised. Our universe therefore could be a dual universe. Also, 8+2 Ds makes a total of 10 Ds; 4x4=16 interactions, and 10+16 = 26. So our 4 D world could act as a 10/26 D world; which matches the 2 sets within which string theory is self- consistent. And this is why N =10. Also, an initial matter singularity would be balanced by antimatter being infinitely spread out at the opposite end of time; so a dual universe would allow an initial singularity to exist with both a known position and momentum, without violating quantum mechanics. And since a dual universe having two equal sets of Ds and matter would always be exactly balanced; a dual universe would be extremely stable all thorough its existence. And this means that our universe is likely to be a dual universe.",physics

  equation","We investigate the integrability of generalized nonautonomous nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equations governing the dynamics of the single- and double-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The integrability conditions obtained indicate that the existence of the nonautonomous soliton is due to the balance between the different competition features: the kinetic energy (dispersion) versus the harmonic external potential applied and the dispersion versus the nonlinearity. In the double-component case, it includes all possible different combinations between the dispersion and nonlinearity involving intra- and inter-interactions. This result shows that the nonautonomous soliton has the same physical origin as the canonical one, which clarifies the nature of the nonautonomous soliton. Finally, we also discuss the dynamics of two-component BEC by controlling the relevant experimental parameters.",physics

  plasma","In this paper, the evolution of the induced axial magnetization due to the propagation of an electromagnetic (em) wave along the static background magnetic field in a two-component plasma has been investigated using the Block equation. The evolution process induces a strong magnetic anisotropy in the plasma medium, depending nonlinearly on the incident wave amplitude. This induced magnetic anisotropy can modify the dispersion relation of the incident em wave, which has been obtained in this paper. In the low frequency Alfven wave limit, this dispersion relation shows that the resulting phase velocity of the incident wave depends on the square of the incident wave amplitude and on the static background magnetic field of plasma. The analytical results are in well agreement with the numerically estimated values in solar corona and sunspots.",physics

It is found that the final angular momentum of the droplets is highly correlated with the initial direction, and that a significant fraction of the alignment of the total angular momentum should be transferred to the rotational angular momentum of an embedded molecule.",physics

716,"Simultaneous observation of forward-backward attosecond photoelectron
  holography","Photoelectron angular momentum distribution of He+ driven by a few-cycle laser is investigated numerically. We simultaneously observe two dominant interference patterns with one shot of lasers by solving the 3D time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE). The analysis of a semiclassical model identifies these two interference patterns as two kinds of photoelectron holography. The interference pattern with Pz > 0 is a kind of forward rescattering holography, which comes from the interference between direct (reference) and rescattered (signal) forward electrons ionized in the same quarter-cycle. The interference pattern with Pz < 0 is a kind of backward rescattering holography, which comes from the interference between direct electron ionized in the third quarter- cycle and rescattered backward electron ionized in the first quarter-cycle. Moreover, we propose a method to distinguish this backward rescattering holography and intracycle interference patterns of direct electrons. This is an important step for dynamic imaging of molecular structure and detecting electron in molecules on attosecond time scale by the backward rescattering attosecond photonelectron holography.",physics

719,How unusual was autumn 2006 in Europe?,"The temperatures in large parts of Europe have been record high during the meteorological autumn of 2006. Compared to 1961-1990, the 2m temperature was more than three degrees Celsius above normal from the North side of the Alps to southern Norway. This made it by far the warmest autumn on record in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, with the records in Central England going back to 1659, in the Netherlands to 1706 and in Denmark to 1768.   Assuming that the mean of the temperature distribution changes proportional to the global mean temperature, but the shape remains the same includes to first order the effects of global warming. Even under this assumption the autumn temperatures were very unusual, with estimates of the return time of 200 to 2000 years in this region. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is more than 100 to 300 years.   Climate models that simulate the current atmospheric circulation well underestimate the observed mean rise in autumn temperatures. They do not simulate a change in the shape of the distribution that would increase the probability of warm events under global warming. This implies that the warm autumn 2006 either was a very rare coincidence, or the local temperature rise is much stronger than modelled, or non-linear physics that is missing from these models increases the probability of warm extremes.",physics
720,"Climate Sensitivity, Sea Level, and Atmospheric CO2","Cenozoic temperature, sea level and CO2 co-variations provide insights into climate sensitivity to external forcings and sea level sensitivity to climate change. Climate sensitivity depends on the initial climate state, but potentially can be accurately inferred from precise paleoclimate data. Pleistocene climate oscillations yield a fast-feedback climate sensitivity 3 +/- 1{\deg}C for 4 W/m2 CO2 forcing if Holocene warming relative to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is used as calibration, but the error (uncertainty) is substantial and partly subjective because of poorly defined LGM global temperature and possible human influences in the Holocene. Glacial-to-interglacial climate change leading to the prior (Eemian) interglacial is less ambiguous and implies a sensitivity in the upper part of the above range, i.e., 3-4{\deg}C for 4 W/m2 CO2 forcing. Slow feedbacks, especially change of ice sheet size and atmospheric CO2, amplify total Earth system sensitivity by an amount that depends on the time scale considered. Ice sheet response time is poorly defined, but we show that the slow response and hysteresis in prevailing ice sheet models are exaggerated. We use a global model, simplified to essential processes, to investigate state-dependence of climate sensitivity, finding an increased sensitivity towards warmer climates, as low cloud cover is diminished and increased water vapor elevates the tropopause. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make much of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to climate change.",physics

We also demonstrate that the death mechanism alone can result in power law degree distributions for the resulting network.",physics
723,Simulations of a micro-PET System based on Liquid Xenon,"The imaging performance of a high-resolution preclinical microPET system employing liquid xenon as the gamma ray detection medium was simulated. The arrangement comprises a ring of detectors consisting of trapezoidal LXe time projection ionization chambers and two arrays of large area avalanche photodiodes for the measurement of ionization charge and scintillation light. A key feature of the LXePET system is the ability to identify individual photon interactions with high energy resolution and high spatial resolution in 3 dimensions and determine the correct interaction sequence using Compton reconstruction algorithms. The simulated LXePET imaging performance was evaluated by computing the noise equivalent count rate, the sensitivity and point spread function for a point source, and by examining the image quality using a micro-Derenzo phantom according to the NEMA-NU4 standard. Results of these simulation studies included NECR peaking at 1326 kcps at 188 MBq (705 kcps at 184 MBq) for an energy window of 450 - 600 keV and a coincidence window of 1 ns for mouse (rat) phantoms. The absolute sensitivity at the center of the field of view was 12.6%. Radial, tangential, and axial resolutions of 22Na point sources reconstructed with a list-mode maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm were <= 0.8 mm (FWHM) throughout the field of view. Hot-rod inserts of < 0.8 mm diameter were resolvable in the transaxial image of a micro-Derenzo phantom.

725,Unstructured intermediate states in single protein force experiments,"Recent single-molecule force measurements on single-domain proteins have highlighted a three-state folding mechanism where a stabilized intermediate state (I) is observed on the folding trajectory between the stretched state and the native state. Here we investigate on-lattice protein-like heteropolymer models that lead to a three-state mechanism and show that force experiments can be useful to determine the structure of I. We have mostly found that I is composed of a core stabilized by a high number of native contacts, plus an unstructured extended chain. The lifetime of I is shown to be sensitive to modifications of the protein that spoil the core. We then propose three types of modifications--point mutations, cuts, and circular permutations--aiming at: (1) confirming the presence of the core and (2) determining its location, within one amino acid accuracy, along the polypeptide chain. We also propose force jump protocols aiming to probe the on/off-pathway nature of I.",physics

Finding the general dispersion relation and analyzing it, we firstly obtain the low frequency oscillations and secondly we show that an instability may develop in the aforementioned system.

An alternative to Kohn-Sham theory is to express the energy as a functional of the reduced first-order density matrix or equivalently the natural orbitals. In the former approach the unknown part of the functional contains both a kinetic and a potential contribution whereas in the latter approach it contains only a potential energy and consequently has simpler scaling properties. We present an approximate, simple and parameter-free functional of the natural orbitals, based solely on scaling arguments and the near satisfaction of a sum rule. Our tests on atoms show that it yields on average more accurate energies and charge densities than the Hartree Fock method, the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximations.",physics

In this paper we show that the global minimum of this criterion can be reached with a linear least square minimization followed by a roots finding algorithm. This is a major advantage compared to classical iterative algorithms such as K-means or EM which suffer from the potential convergence to some local extrema of the cost function they use. Our algorithm performances are finally illustrated through simulations of a five components mixture.",physics

The classical Heaviside formula for the electric field of a moving charge predicts that, for the particular spatial configuration considered, the inductive force vanishes in the frame in which the magnet is in motion and the test charge at rest. In contrast, consistent results, in different frames, are given by the recently derived formulae of relativistic classical electrodynamics.",physics
735,"Steric effects in the dynamics of electrolytes at large applied
  voltages: II. Modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations","In situations involving large potentials or surface charges, the Poisson Boltzman(PB) equation has shortcomings because it neglects ion-ion interactions and steric effects. This has been widely recognized by the electrochemistry community, leading to the development of various alternative models resulting in different sets ""modified PB equations"", which have had at least qualitative success in predicting equilibrium ion distributions. On the other hand, the literature is scarce in terms of descriptions of concentration dynamics in these regimes. Here, adapting strategies developed to modify the PB equation, we propose a simple modification of the widely used Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for ionic transport, which at least qualitatively accounts for steric effects. We analyze numerical solutions of these MPNP equations on the model problem of the charging of a simple electrolyte cell, and compare the outcome to that of the standard PNP equations. Finally, we repeat the asymptotic analysis of Bazant, Thornton, and Ajdari(2004} for this new system of equations to further document the interest and limits of validity of the simpler equivalent electrical circuit models introduced in Part I for such problems.",physics
736,Plasma Heating by an Electron Beam in Corrugated Magnetic Field,"New experimental results from the multimirror trap GOL-3 are presented. Deuterium plasma of $~10^21 m^-3$ density is heated by a high power relativistic electron beam (peak parameters are ~1 MeV, ~25 kA, ~8 $\mu$s, ~120 kJ). Magnetic system of the facility is a 12-meter-long axisymmetrical solenoid with corrugated magnetic field, which consists of 55 cells with $B_max/B_min$=4.8/3.2 T. Collective plasma heating by the electron beam results in peak electron temperature ~2 keV. To this time the ions are also collectively heated by gradients of electron pressure in the cells of the trap. Ion temperature increases above 1 keV and confines at the high level for ~1 ms. Dense hot plasma in GOL-3 trap emits D-D neutrons for ~1 ms. Details of collective plasma heating by the beam in the corrugated magnetic field will be presented in the paper. New physical mechanism of effective heating of plasma ions, substantially dependent on the corrugation of the magnetic field, is discussed. Experiments with complete multimirror configuration of the GOL-3 facility have shown the significant improvement of energy confinement time comparing with simple solenoidal configuration. Axial currents, which exist in the system, cause sheared helical structure of the magnetic field. The safety factor q is shown to be below unity on the axis.",physics
737,Clustering in Complex Directed Networks,"Many empirical networks display an inherent tendency to cluster, i.e. to form circles of connected nodes. This feature is typically measured by the clustering coefficient (CC). The CC, originally introduced for binary, undirected graphs, has been recently generalized to weighted, undirected networks. Here we extend the CC to the case of (binary and weighted) directed networks and we compute its expected value for random graphs. We distinguish between CCs that count all directed triangles in the graph (independently of the direction of their edges) and CCs that only consider particular types of directed triangles (e.g., cycles). The main concepts are illustrated by employing empirical data on world-trade flows.",physics
738,"Highly sensitive piezotronic pressure sensors based on undoped GaAs
  nanowire ensembles","Semiconducting piezoelectric materials have attracted considerable interest due to their central role in the emerging field of piezotronics, where the development of a piezo-potential in response to stress or strain can be used to tune the band structure of the semiconductor, and hence its electronic properties. This coupling between piezoelectricity and semiconducting properties can be readily exploited for force or pressure sensing using nanowires, where the geometry and unclamped nature of nanowires render them particularly sensitive to small forces. At the same time, piezoelectricity is known to manifest more strongly in nanowires of certain semiconductors. Here, we report the design and fabrication of highly sensitive piezotronic pressure sensors based on GaAs nanowire ensemble sandwiched between two electrodes in a back-to-back diode configuration. We analyse the current-voltage characteristics of these nanowire-based devices in response to mechanical loading in light of the corresponding changes to the device band structure. We observe a high piezotronic sensitivity to pressure, of ~7800 meV/MPa. We attribute this high sensitivity to the nanowires being fully depleted due to the lack of doping, as well as due to geometrical pressure focusing and current funneling through polar interfaces.",physics
739,"Electromagnetic Quantum Gravity: On the Quantum Principle of
  Equivalence, Quantum Inertia, and the Meaning of Mass","A new approach to Quantum Gravity is proposed that is manifestly compatible with Cellular Automata (CA) theory, and is based on a new quantum theory of inertia where Newtonian Inertia results from the electromagnetic forces between the (electrically) charged elementary particles of an accelerated mass and the surrounding (electrically) charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. At the Plank scale, there exists a quantized, absolute 3D space and separate (quantized) time which is not affected by motion or gravity. Light is the simple shifting of a photon information pattern from cell to adjacent cell at every CA 'clock cycle'. The Lorentz transformation is derived from our simple model of light motion. Inertial mass is revised to acknowledge the absolute nature of mass and acceleration. The same electromagnetic quantum vacuum forces are also present in masses inside a gravitational field, where now the quantum vacuum is accelerated with respect to the mass by graviton exchanges. This process is responsible for the equivalence principle (WEP), which is derived in detail. Gravity is found to be based on two boson force exchange particles: the graviton and the photon, and both particles are postulated to be almost identical in physical characteristics. 4D space-time curvature is found to result from a 'Fizeau-like' scattering process, where the accelerated (electrically charged) virtual particles of the quantum vacuum act like a special 'Fizeau fluid'. Light scatters with the electrically charged and accelerated 'Fizeau fluid', resulting in curved paths. Four experimental tests of EMQG are proposed.",physics
740,Trial wave functions for High-Pressure Metallic Hydrogen,"Many body trial wave functions are the key ingredient for accurate Quantum Monte Carlo estimates of total electronic energies in many electron systems. In the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method, the accuracy of the trial function must be conjugated with the efficiency of its evaluation. We report recent progress in trial wave functions for metallic hydrogen implemented in the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method. We describe and characterize several types of trial functions of increasing complexity in the range of the coupling parameter $1.0 \leq r_s \leq1.55$. We report wave function comparisons for disordered protonic configurations and preliminary results for thermal averages.",physics
741,On the Spatial Scaling of Seismicity Rate,"Scaling analysis of seismicity in the space-time-magnitude domain very often starts from the relation N(m,L)=a(L)*10**(-bm)*L**c for the rate of seismic events of magnitude M>m in an area of size L. There is some evidence in favor of multifractality being present in seismicity. In this case the optimal choice of the scale exponent c is not unique. It is shown how different c's are related to different types of spatial averaging applied to N(m,L) and what are the c's for which the distributions of a(L) best agree for small L. Theoretical analysis is tested using California data.",physics
742,"Electron/pion separation with an Emulsion Cloud Chamber by using a
  Neural Network",We have studied the performance of a new algorithm for electron/pion separation in an Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC) made of lead and nuclear emulsion films. The software for separation consists of two parts: a shower reconstruction algorithm and a Neural Network that assigns to each reconstructed shower the probability to be an electron or a pion. The performance has been studied for the ECC of the OPERA experiment [1].   The $e/\pi$ separation algorithm has been optimized by using a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the ECC and tested on real data taken at CERN (pion beams) and at DESY (electron beams). The algorithm allows to achieve a 90% electron identification efficiency with a pion misidentification smaller than 1% for energies higher than 2 GeV.,physics
743,"High Sensitive Measurement of Absorption Coefficient and Optical
  Nonlinearities with a Single Experimental Setup","Accurate knowledge of absorption coefficient of a sample is a prerequisite for measuring the third order optical nonlinearity of materials, which could become a serious limitation for unknown samples. We introduce a new method, which measures both the absorption coefficient and the third order optical nonlinearity of materials with high sensitivity in a single experimental setup. We use a dual-beam pump-probe experiment under different conditions to achieve this goal. We also demonstrate a counterintuitive coupling of the non-interacting probe-beam with the pump-beam in pump-probe z-scan experiment.",physics
744,"Scaling functional patterns of skeletal and cardiac muscles: New
  non-linear elasticity approach","Responding mechanically to environmental requests, muscles show a surprisingly large variety of functions. The studies of in vivo cycling muscles qualified skeletal muscles into four principal locomotor patterns: motor, brake, strut, and spring. While much effort of has been done in searching for muscle design patterns, no fundamental concepts underlying empirically established patterns were revealed. In this interdisciplinary study, continuum mechanics is applied to the problem of muscle structure in relation to function. The ability of a powering muscle, treated as a homogenous solid organ, tuned to efficient locomotion via the natural frequency is illuminated through the non-linear elastic muscle moduli controlled by contraction velocity. The exploration of the elastic force patterns known in solid state physics incorporated in activated skeletal and cardiac muscles via the mechanical similarity principle yields analytical rationalization for locomotor muscle patterns. Besides the explanation of the origin of muscle allometric exponents observed for muscles in legs of running animals and wings of flying birds, the striated muscles are patterned through primary and secondary activities expected to be useful in designing of artificial muscles and modeling living and extinct animals.",physics
745,Multifractal Analysis of Polyalanines Time Series,"Multifractal properties of the energy time series of short $\alpha$-helix structures, specifically from a polyalanine family, are investigated through the MF-DFA technique ({\it{multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis}}). Estimates for the generalized Hurst exponent $h(q)$ and its associated multifractal exponents $\tau(q)$ are obtained for several series generated by numerical simulations of molecular dynamics in different systems from distinct initial conformations. All simulations were performed using the GROMOS force field, implemented in the program THOR. The main results have shown that all series exhibit multifractal behavior depending on the number of residues and temperature. Moreover, the multifractal spectra reveal important aspects on the time evolution of the system and suggest that the nucleation process of the secondary structures during the visits on the energy hyper-surface is an essential feature of the folding process.",physics

  for the KamLAND experiment","KamLAND is a reactor neutrino oscillation experiment with a very long baseline. This experiment successfully measured oscillation phenomena of reactor antineutrinos coming mainly from 53 reactors in Japan. In order to extract the results, it is necessary to accurately calculate time-dependent antineutrino spectra from all the reactors. A simple model of reactor cores and code implementing it were developed for this purpose. This paper describes the model of the reactor cores used in the KamLAND reactor analysis.",physics
747,"The interpretation of the Einstein-Rupp experiments and their influence
  on the history of quantum mechanics","The Einstein-Rupp experiments were proposed in 1926 by Albert Einstein to study the wave versus particle nature of light. Einstein presented a theoretical analysis of these experiments to the Berlin Academy together with results of Emil Rupp, who claimed to have successfully carried them out. However, as the preceding paper has claimed (HSPS 37 Suppl. (2007), 73-121), Rupp's success was the result of scientific fraud. This paper will argue, after exploring their interpretation, that the experiments were a relevant part of the background to such celebrated contributions to quantum mechanics as Born's statistical interpretation of the wave function and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Yet, the Einstein-Rupp experiments have hardly received attention in the history of quantum mechanics literature. In part, this is a consequence of self-censorship in the physics community, enforced in the wake of the Rupp affair. Self-censorship among historians of physics may however also have played a role.",physics
748,Microfluidic capturing-dynamics of paramagnetic bead suspensions,We study theoretically the capturing of paramagnetic beads by a magnetic field gradient in a microfluidic channel treating the beads as a continuum. Bead motion is affected by both fluidic and magnetic forces. The transfer of momentum from beads to the fluid creates an effective bead-bead interaction that greatly aids capturing. We demonstrate that for a given inlet flow speed a critical density of beads exists above which complete capturing takes place.,physics
749,"Spreading and localization of information in scale-free networks with
  communication constraints","We study localization of information on scale free networks with communication constraints when, for some reason, information can propagate only between ``mutually trusted nodes'' (MTN). We propose an algorithm to construct the MTN network and show that there is a critical value of trusted nodes below which information localizes. This critical value increases drastically if a fraction p of nodes does not transfer information at all. We study the fraction of initial messangers needed to inform a desired fraction of the network as a function of the average number of trusted nodes and discuss possible applications of the model to marketing, to the spreading of risky information and to the spreading of a disease with very short incubation time.",physics
750,Stiffening of semiflexible biopolymers and cross-linked networks,"We study the mechanical stiffening behavior in two-dimensional (2D) cross-linked networks of semiflexible biopolymer filaments under simple shear. Filamental constituents immersed in a fluid undergo thermally excited bending motions. Pulling out these undulations results in an increase in the axial stiffness. We analyze this stiffening behavior of 2D semiflexible filaments in detail: we first investigate the average, {static} force-extension relation by considering the initially present undulated configuration that is pulled straight under a tensile force, and compare this result with the average response in which undulation dynamics is allowed during pulling, as derived earlier by MacKintosh and coworkers. We will show that the resulting mechanical behavior is rather similar, but with the axial stiffness being a factor 2 to 4 larger in the dynamic model. Furthermore, we study the stretching contribution in case of extensible filaments and show that, for 2D filaments, the mechanical response is dominated by {enthalpic} stretching. Based on the single-filament mechanics, we develop a 2D analytical model describing the mechanical behavior of biopolymer networks under simple shear, adopting the affine deformation assumption. These results are compared with discrete, finite-element (FE) calculations of a network consisting of semiflexible filaments. The FE calculations show that local, nonaffine filament reorientations occur that induce a transition from a bending-dominated response at small strains to a stretching-dominated response at larger strains. Stiffening in biopolymer networks thus results from a combination of stiffening in individual filaments and changes in the network topography.",physics
751,"Reconnection in the Centre of the Near-Earth Plasma Sheet: Control by
  Plasma Drifts and Magnetic Flux Convection close to the Earth","Convection inside the magnetosphere can be regarded as the transfer of magnetic flux and plasma from the magnetotail into the nightside and then convection and drift from there to the dayside. As in many fluid flow situations, the downstream flow (the convection and drift to the dayside) is an important boundary condition for the upstream flow (reconnection and inflow from the tail). Tail-like flux tubes in the near-earth plasma sheet block inflow from the tail between reconnection events. However, the westward drift of the energetic ions (curvature and gradient drift and ExB drift) removes plasma energy from near midnight causing deflation and earthward flow in the equatorial plane. (The process can be described as the westward drift of the eastern of the plasma sheet / partial ring current.) The earthward flow removes magnetic flux and plasma from the center of the thick plasma sheet and creates a thin current sheet, which, in turn, favors the onset of reconnection. The X line forms just tailward of the earthward-flow region. Initially, reconnection occurs by the earthward propagation of the X line and the growth of a magnetic island on its tailward side, since there is no downtail flow. Subsequently, the system evolves towards lobe merging, and the X line propagates tailward consistent with the standard picture of tail reconnection. The east-west width of the local-time slot in which inflow and reconnection occur is determined by the scale-length of the decrease in plasma energy at the eastern end of the drifting ions. It is expected that the reconnection slot follows the westward drift of the eastern end of the partial ring current. The model appears to be consistent with bursty bulk flows, the westward traveling surge and many other observed properties of substorms.",physics

754,A method for testing bullets at reduced velocity,"Reconstruction of shooting events occasionally requires testing of bullets at velocities significantly below the typical muzzle velocity of cartridge arms. Trajectory, drag, and terminal performance depend strongly on velocity, and realistic results require accurately reconstructing the velocity. A method is presented for testing bullets at reduced velocities by loading the bullet into a sabot and firing from a muzzle loading rifle with a suitably reduced powder charge. Powder charges can be safely reduced to any desirable level when shooting saboted bullets from a muzzleloader; in contrast, cartridge arms can only be safely operated within a narrow window of powder charges/muzzle velocities. This technique is applicable to a wide range of both pistol and rifle bullets at velocities from 700 ft/s to 2000 ft/s.",physics
755,Acoustic methods for measuring bullet velocity,"This article describes two acoustic methods to measure bullet velocity with an accuracy of 1% or better. In one method, a microphone is placed within 0.1 m of the gun muzzle and a bullet is fired at a steel target 45 m away. The bullet's flight time is the recorded time between the muzzle blast and sound of hitting the target minus the time for the sound to return from the target to the microphone. In the other method, the microphone is placed equidistant from both the gun muzzle and the steel target 91 m away. The time of flight is the recorded time between the muzzle blast and the sound of the bullet hitting the target. In both cases, the average bullet velocity is simply the flight distance divided by the flight time.",physics
756,The Adiabatic Invariance of the Action Variable in Classical Dynamics,"We consider one-dimensional classical time-dependent Hamiltonian systems with quasi-periodic orbits. It is well-known that such systems possess an adiabatic invariant which coincides with the action variable of the Hamiltonian formalism. We present a new proof of the adiabatic invariance of this quantity and illustrate our arguments by means of explicit calculations for the harmonic oscillator.   The new proof makes essential use of the Hamiltonian formalism. The key step is the introduction of a slowly-varying quantity closely related to the action variable. This new quantity arises naturally within the Hamiltonian framework as follows: a canonical transformation is first performed to convert the system to action-angle coordinates; then the new quantity is constructed as an action integral (effectively a new action variable) using the new coordinates. The integration required for this construction provides, in a natural way, the averaging procedure introduced in other proofs, though here it is an average in phase space rather than over time.",physics
757,"Detection of Influenza A Virus Nucleoprotein Through the Self-Assembly
  of Nanoparticles in Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy-Based Bioassays: A Method
  for Rapid, Sensitive, and Wash-free Magnetic Immunoassays","Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with proper surface functionalization have been extensively applied as labels for magnetic immunoassays, carriers for controlled drug/gene delivery, tracers and contrasts for magnetic imaging, etc. Here, we introduce a new biosensing scheme based on magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and the self-assembly of MNPs to quantitatively detect H1N1 nucleoprotein molecules. MPS monitors the harmonics of oscillating MNPs as a metric for the freedom of rotational motion, thus indicating the bound states of MNPs. These harmonics can be readily collected from nanogram quantities of iron oxide nanoparticles within 10 s. H1N1 nucleoprotein molecule hosts multiple different epitopes that forms binding sites for many IgG polyclonal antibodies. Anchoring IgG polyclonal antibodies onto MNPs triggers the cross-linking between MNPs and H1N1 nucleoprotein molecules, thereby forming MNP self-assemblies. Using MPS and the self-assembly of MNPs, we achieved the sensitivity of 44 nM (442 pmole) for detecting H1N1 nucleoprotein. In addition, the morphologies and the hydrodynamic sizes of the MNP self-assemblies are characterized to verify the MPS results. Different MNP self-assembly models such as classical cluster, open ring tetramer, chain model as well as multimers (from dimer to pentamer) are proposed in this paper. Herein, we claim the feasibility of using MPS and the self-assembly of MNPs as a new biosensing scheme for detecting ultralow concentrations of target biomolecules, which can be employed as rapid, sensitive, and wash-free magnetic immunoassays.",physics

The residual He(1s2s ^{3}S) atoms were resonantly ionized and the resulting He^+ ions were detected in the presence of a small background. A collinear laser-ion beam apparatus was used to attain both high resolution and sensitivity.

762,Quantum Gravity,"Gravitons should have momentum just as photons do; and since graviton momentum would cause compression rather than elongation of spacetime outside of matter; it does not appear that gravitons are compatible with Swartzchild's spacetime curvature. Also, since energy is proportional to mass, and mass is proportional to gravity; the energy of matter is proportional to gravity. The energy of matter could thus contract space within matter; and because of the inter-connectedness of space, cause the elongation of space outside of matter. And this would be compatible with Swartzchild spacetime curvature. Since gravity could be initiated within matter by the energy of mass, transmitted to space outside of matter by the inter-connectedness of space; and also transmitted through space by the same inter-connectedness of space; and since spatial and relativistic gravities can apparently be produced without the aid of gravitons; massive gravity could also be produced without gravitons as well.   Gravity divided by an infinite number of segments would result in zero expression of gravity, because it could not curve spacetime. So spatial segments must have a minimum size, which is the Planck length; thus resulting in quantized space. And since gravity is always expressed over some distance in space, quantum space would therefore always quantize gravity. So the non-mediation of gravity by gravitons does not result in unquantized gravity, because quantum space can quantize gravity; thus making gravitons unproven and unnecessary, and explaining why gravitons have never been found.",physics
763,"Significance of a combined approach for replacement stones in the
  heritage buildings' conservation frame","Stone substitution is a conventional operation during heritage buildings' restoration, but becomes problematic for architects and restorers when the quarry is mined out. The compatibility of the substitution stones with the original ones has been for long mainly based on the aesthetical aspect, this resulting too often in a patchwork of original and substitution stones with different patina after several years because of differences of properties. In this study, the objective is to show how substitution stones can be selected by combining aesthetic criteria and stones properties that are relevant for analyzing their compatibility. A couple of French limestones with their potential substitution stones were selected for the study. Our results showed that potential substitution stones selected on their aesthetic criteria require to be rejected because of their differences of physical properties. On the other hand, our results showed also the possibility to select substitution stones with satisfactory aesthetic aspect and properties that enable to expect a satisfactory compatibility with the original stone.",physics

765,"Overheat Instability in an Ascending Moist Air Flow as a Mechanism of
  Hurricane Formation","The universal instability mechanism in an ascending moist air flow is theoretically proposed and analyzed. Its origin comes to the conflict between two processes: the increasing of pressure forcing applied to the boundary layer and the decelerating of the updraft flow due to air heating. It is shown that the intensification of tropical storm with the redistribution of wind velocities, pressure and temperature can result from the reorganization of the dissipative structure which key parameters are the moist air lifting velocity and the temperature of surrounding atmosphere. This reorganization can lead to formation of hurricane eye and inner ring of convection. A transition of the dissipative structure in a new state can occur when the temperature lapse rate in a zone of air lifting reaches certain critical value. The accordance of observational data with the proposed theoretical description is shown.",physics

  of Spatial and Temporal Distances. II. the Comparison with Experiments","Some of the well-known experiments: the ''muon'' experiment, the Michelson-Morley type experiments, the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments and the Ives-Stilwell type experiments are analyzed using the nonrelativistic theory, the ''apparent transformations (AT) relativity'' and the ''true transformations (TT) relativity.'' It is shown that all the experiments (when they are complete from the ''TT relativity'' viewpoint) are in agreement with the ''TT relativity'' in which the special relativity is understood as the theory of a four-dimensional spacetime with the pseudo-Euclidean geometry. It is also explicitly shown that, in contrast to the usual opinion, the commonly used ''AT relativity'' does not always agree with experiments. The concept of sameness of a physical quantity is essential for the distinction between the two forms of relativity both in the theory and in experiments. The difference in this concept causes the agreement of the ''TT relativity'' with the experiments and the disagreement of the ''AT relativity.''",physics

768,"An XML Driven Graphical User Interface and Application Management
  Toolkit","In the past, the features of a user interface were limited by those available in the existing graphical widgets it used. Now, improvements in processor speed have fostered the emergence of interpreted languages, in which the appropriate method to render a given data object can be loaded at runtime. XML can be used to precisely describe the association of data types with their graphical handling (beans), and Java provides an especially rich environment for programming the graphics. We present a graphical user interface builder based on Java Beans and XML, in which the graphical screens are described textually (in files or a database) in terms of their screen components. Each component may be a simple text read back, or a complex plot. The programming model provides for dynamic data pertaining to a component to be forwarded synchronously or asynchronously, to the appropriate handler, which may be a built-in method, or a complex applet. This work was initially motivated by the need to move the legacy VMS display interface of the SLAC Control Program to another platform while preserving all of its existing functionality. However the model allows us a powerful and generic system for adding new kinds of graphics, such as Matlab, data sources, such as EPICS, middleware, such as AIDA[1], and transport, such as XML and SOAP. The system will also include a management console, which will be able to report on the present usage of the system, for instance who is running it where and connected to which channels.",physics
769,Adiabatic passage by light-induced potentials in molecules,"We present the APLIP process (Adiabatic Passage by Light Induced Potentials) for the adiabatic transfer of a wave packet from one molecular potential to the displaced ground vibrational state of another. The process uses an intermediate state, which is only slightly populated, and a counterintuitive sequence of light pulses to couple the three molecular states. APLIP shares many features with STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage), such as high efficiency and insensitivity to pulse parameters. However, in APLIP there is no two-photon resonance, and the main mechanism for the transport of the wave packet is a light-induced potential. The APLIP process appears to violate the Franck-Condon principle, because of the displacement of the wave packet, but does in fact take place on timescales which are at least a little longer than a vibrational timescale.",physics
770,Plasma treatment advantages for textiles,"The textile industry is searching for innovative production techniques to improve the product quality, as well as society requires new finishing techniques working in environmental respect. Plasma surface treatments show distinct advantages, because they are able to modify the surface properties of inert materials, sometimes with environment friendly devices. For fabrics, cold plasma treatments require the development of reliable and large systems. Such systems are now existing and the use of plasma physics in industrial problems is rapidly increasing. On textile surfaces, three main effects can be obtained depending on the treatment conditions: the cleaning effect, the increase of microroughness (anti-pilling finishing of wool) and the production of radicals to obtain hydrophilic surfaces. Plasma polymerisation, that is the deposition of solid polymeric materials with desired properties on textile substrates, is under development. The advantage of such plasma treatments is that the modification turns out to be restricted in the uppermost layers of the substrate, thus not affecting the overall desirable bulk properties. Here, we present the research results on the use of plasma physics in textile properties modification. Treatments on natural, wool and cotton, and on synthetic polymers to improve wetting are shown. Hydrophilic-hydrophobic treatments, dirt-repellent coatings are presented. Low-pressure and atmospheric-pressure glow discharge systems are also discussed.",physics

  ionized plasma","A high-density magnetized plasma has been studied for understanding of plasma dynamics in partially ionized plasmas. Ion flow field has been obtained experimentally, and is shown to be associated with a vortex formation. The most remarkable result is that the direction of rotation is opposite to that of the ExB drift. Measurement of neutral density profile reveals that there is a steep density gradient of the neutrals around the vortex, suggesting that the generation of inward momentum of the neutrals due to the density gradient. The momentum is transfered to ion with charge-exchange collision, and cause effective force on the ion. The present experiment shows that this effective force may dominate the ambipolar-electric field and drive the anti-ExB vortical motion of ions.",physics
772,Opinion formation models based on game theory,"A way to simulate the basic interactions between two individuals with different opinions, in the context of strategic game theory, is proposed. Various games are considered, which produce different kinds of opinion formation dynamics. First, by assuming that all individuals (players) are equals, we obtain the bounded confidence model of continuous opinion dynamics proposed by Deffuant et al. In such a model a tolerance threshold is defined, such that individuals with difference in opinion larger than the threshold can not interact. Then, we consider that the individuals have different inclinations to change opinion and different abilities in convincing the others. In this way, we obtain the so-called ``Stubborn individuals and Orators'' (SO) model, a generalization of the Deffuant et al. model, in which the threshold tolerance is different for every couple of individuals. We explore, by numerical simulations, the dynamics of the SO model, and we propose further generalizations that can be implemented.",physics
773,"Scale Invariant Markov Models for Bayesian Inversion of Linear Inverse
  Problems","In a Bayesian approach for solving linear inverse problems one needs to specify the prior laws for calculation of the posterior law. A cost function can also be defined in order to have a common tool for various Bayesian estimators which depend on the data and the hyperparameters. The Gaussian case excepted, these estimators are not linear and so depend on the scale of the measurements. In this paper a weaker property than linearity is imposed on the Bayesian estimator, namely the scale invariance property (SIP).First, we state some results on linear estimation and then we introduce and justify a scale invariance axiom. We show that arbitrary choice of scale measurement can be avoided if the estimator has this SIP. Some examples of classical regularization procedures are shown to be scale invariant. Then we investigate general conditions on classes of Bayesian estimators which satisfy this SIP, as well as their consequences on the cost function and prior laws. We also show that classical methods for hyperparameters estimation (i.e., Maximum Likelihood and Generalized Maximum Likelihood) can be introduced for hyperparameters estimation, and we verify the SIP property for them. Finally we discuss how to choose the prior laws to obtain scale invariant Bayesian estimators. For this, we consider two cases of prior laws: {\em entropic prior laws} and {\em first-order Markov models}. In related preceding works [Mohammad-Djafari90,Mohammad-Djafari93], the SIP constraints have been studied for the case of entropic prior laws. In this paper extension to the case of first-order Markov models is provided.

774,Delayed pull-in transitions in overdamped MEMS devices,"We consider the dynamics of overdamped MEMS devices undergoing the pull-in instability. Numerous previous experiments and numerical simulations have shown a significant increase in the pull-in time under DC voltages close to the pull-in voltage. Here the transient dynamics slow down as the device passes through a meta-stable or bottleneck phase, but this slowing down is not well understood quantitatively. Using a lumped parallel-plate model, we perform a detailed analysis of the pull-in dynamics in this regime. We show that the bottleneck phenomenon is a type of critical slowing down arising from the pull-in transition. This allows us to show that the pull-in time obeys an inverse square-root scaling law as the transition is approached; moreover we determine an analytical expression for this pull-in time. We then compare our prediction to a wide range of pull-in time data reported in the literature, showing that the observed slowing down is well captured by our scaling law, which appears to be generic for overdamped pull-in under DC loads. This realization provides a useful design rule with which to tune dynamic response in applications, including state-of-the-art accelerometers and pressure sensors that use pull-in time as a sensing mechanism. We also propose a method to estimate the pull-in voltage based only on data of the pull-in times.",physics
775,A geostrophic-like model for large Hartmann number flows,"A flow of electrically conducting fluid in the presence of a steady magnetic field has a tendency to become quasi two-dimensional, i.e. uniform in the direction of the magnetic field, except in thin so-called Hartmann boundary layers. The condition for this tendency is that of a strong magnetic field, corresponding to large values of the dimensionless Hartmann number (Ha >> 1). This is analogous to the case of low Ekman number rotating flows, with Ekman layers replacing Hartmann layers. This has been at the origin of the homogeneous model for flows in a rotating frame of reference, with its rich structure: geostrophic contours and shear layers of Stewartson, Munk and Stommel. In magnetohydrodynamics, the characteristic surfaces introduced by Kulikovskii play a role similar to the role of the geostrophic contours. However, a general theory for quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics is lacking. In this paper, a model is proposed which provides a general framework for quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flows. Not only can this model account for otherwise disconnected past results, but it is also used to predict a new type of shear layer, of typical thickness Ha^{-1/4}.",physics

777,A Spin Glass Model of Human Logic Systems,"In this paper, we discuss different models for human logic systems and describe a game with nature. Godel`s incompleteness theorem is taken into account to construct a model of logical networks based on axioms obtained by symmetry breaking. We start by saying that although an agent is rational, the axioms defining different agent's logic systems need not be the same although they might have a large degree of overlap. This can be seen as each agent being coupled to a higher dimensional world by means of his perception where the couplings produce slightly different projections of the higher dimensional world to each agent. The different projections would produce slightly different concepts about the ""world"" to each agent and hence create a slightly differing set of axioms that each agent would use to act logically. Then we place the agents in an interacting logical network, where these axioms can be treated as spins that can be flipped as agents interact with each other and with the environment in which they are placed. Agents, who would share a common material world that they wish to use or change by using different or conflicting sets of axioms will try to flip the other agent's axioms (This can be seen by observing that as one agent acts to interact with his world as followed by his axiom, another agent's world changes as well, and the change might be contradictory to the second agent's ""axioms"" or ""optimal world"". We define an equation that allows an axiom to be flipped into an ""anti axiom (the opposite or conflicting axiom)"" as agents interact. All agents share an ""existence"" axiom by means of which they strive to perpetuate themselves or the network.",physics
778,"Mechanical deformation of monocytic THP-1 cells : occurrence of two
  seqential phases with differential sensitivity to metabolic inhibitors","Blood leukocytes can exhibit extensive morphological changes during their passage through small capillary vessels. The human monocytic THP-1 cell line was used to explore the metabolic dependence of these shape changes. Cells were aspirated into micropipettes for determination of the rate of protrusion formation. They were then released and the kinetics of morphological recovery was studied. Results were consistent with Evans' model (Blood, 64 : 1028, 1984) of a viscous liquid droplet surrounded by a tensile membrane. The estimated values of cytoplasmic viscosity and membrane tension were 162 Pa.s and 0.0142 millinewton/m respectively. The influence of metabolic inhibitors on cell mechanical behaviour was then studied : results strongly suggested that deformation involved two sequential phases. The cell elongation rate measured during the first 30 seconds following the onset of aspiration was unaffected by azide, an inhibitor of energy production, and it was about doubled by cytochalasin D, a microfilament inhibitor, and colchicine, a microtubule inhibitor. However, during the following two minutes, deformation was almost abolished in cells treated with azide and cytochalasin D, whereas the protrusion of control cells exhibited about threefold length increase. It is concluded that, although cells seemed to deform as passive objects, active metabolic processes were required to allow extensive morphological changes triggered by external forces.",physics
779,Emergence of cooperation induced by preferential learning,"The evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) and the Snowdrift Game (SG) with preferential learning mechanism are studied in the Barab\'asi-Albert network. Simulation results demonstrate that the preferential learning of individuals remarkably promotes the cooperative behavior for both two games over a wide range of payoffs. To understand the effect of preferential learning on the evolution of the systems, we investigate the time series of the cooperator density for different preferential strength and payoffs. It is found that in some specific cases two games both show the $1/f$-scaling behaviors, which indicate the existence of long range correlation. We also figure out that when the large degree nodes have high probability to be selected, the PDG displays a punctuated equilibrium-type behavior. On the contrary, the SG exhibits a sudden increase feature. These temporary instable behaviors are ascribed to the strategy shift of the large degree nodes.",physics
780,"Spontaneous-emission rates in finite photonic crystals of plane
  scatterers","The concept of a plane scatterer that was developed earlier for scalar waves is generalized so that polarization of light is included. Starting from a Lippmann-Schwinger formalism for vector waves, we show that the Green function has to be regularized before T-matrices can be defined in a consistent way. After the regularization, optical modes and Green functions are determined exactly for finite structures built up of an arbitrary number of parallel planes, at arbitrary positions, and where each plane can have different optical properties. The model is applied to the special case of finite crystals consisting of regularly spaced identical planes, where analytical methods can be taken further and only light numerical tasks remain. The formalism is used to calculate position- and orientation-dependent spontaneous-emission rates inside and near the finite photonic crystals. The results show that emission rates and reflection properties can differ strongly for scalar and for vector waves. The finite size of the crystal influences the emission rates. For parallel dipoles close to a plane, emission into guided modes gives rise to a peak in the frequency-dependent emission rate.",physics
781,"A generalisation of classical electrodynamics for the prediction of
  scalar field effects","Within the framework of Classical Electrodynamics (CED) it is common practice to choose freely an arbitrary gauge condition with respect to a gauge transformation of the electromagnetic potentials. The Lorenz gauge condition allows for the derivation of the inhomogeneous potential wave equations (IPWE), but this also means that scalar derivatives of the electromagnetic potentials are considered to be \emph{unphysical}. However, these scalar expressions might have the meaning of a new physical field, $\mathsf S$. If this is the case, then a generalised CED is required such that scalar field effects are predicted and such that experiments can be performed in order to verify or falsify this generalised CED. The IPWE are viewed as a generalised Gauss law and a generalised Ampe\`re law, that also contain derivatives of $\mathsf S$, after reformulating the IPWE in terms of fields.   Some recent experiment show positive results that are in qualitative agreement with the presented predictions of scalar field effects, but further quantitative tests are required in order to verify or falsify the presented theory. The importance of Nikola Tesla's pioneering research, with respect to the predicted effects, cannot be overstated.",physics
782,"A simplified model of the source channel of the Leksell GammaKnife
  tested with PENELOPE","Monte Carlo simulations using the code PENELOPE have been performed to test a simplified model of the source channel geometry of the Leksell GammaKnife$^{\circledR}$. The characteristics of the radiation passing through the treatment helmets are analysed in detail. We have found that only primary particles emitted from the source with polar angles smaller than 3$^{\rm o}$ with respect to the beam axis are relevant for the dosimetry of the Gamma Knife. The photons trajectories reaching the output helmet collimators at $(x,y,z=236 {\rm mm})$, show strong correlations between $\rho=(x^2+y^2)^{1/2}$ and their polar angle $\theta$, on one side, and between $\tan^{-1}(y/x)$ and their azimuthal angle $\phi$, on the other. This enables us to propose a simplified model which treats the full source channel as a mathematical collimator. This simplified model produces doses in excellent agreement with those found for the full geometry. In the region of maximal dose, the relative differences between both calculations are within 3%, for the 18 and 14 mm helmets, and 10%, for the 8 and 4 mm ones. Besides, the simplified model permits a strong reduction (larger than a factor 15) in the computational time.",physics
783,"The seismogenic area in the lithosphere considered as an ""Open Physical
  System"". Its implications on some seismological aspects. Part - III. Seismic
  Potential","The seismic potential of any regional seismogenic area is analyzed in terms of the ""open physical system"" inflow - outflow energy balance model (Thanassoulas, 2008, Part - I). Following the magnitude determination method presented by Thanassoulas, (2008, Part - II) any region of any arbitrary area extent is assumed as being a potential seismogenic region. Consequently, the capability for the generation of a maximum magnitude future EQ at each virtual seismogenic region is investigated all over Greece at certain times. The later results are used to compile maps of the seismic potential / maximum expected EQ magnitude for Greece at 5 year's intervals ranging from 1970 to 2000. The comparison of these seismic potential maps / maximum expected EQ magnitude to the corresponding seismicity (M>6R) for each corresponding 5 years period reveals their tight interrelation. Therefore, the calculated seismic potential / maximum expected EQ magnitude, due to its drastic change in time in any seismogenic region, is a dynamic in time parameter which indicates the seismic energy charge status of each seismogenic area.",physics

  microscopy on Cu(100) and Al(111)","The dynamic characteristics of a tip oscillating in the nc-AFM mode in close vicinity to a Cu(100)-surface are investigated by means of phase variation experiments in the constant amplitude mode. The change of the quality factor upon approaching the surface deduced from both frequency shift and excitation versus phase curves yield to consistent values. The optimum phase is found to be independent of distance. The dependence of the quality factor on distance is related to 'true' damping, because artefacts related to phase misadjustment can be excluded. The experimental results, as well as on-resonance measurements at different bias voltages on an Al(111) surface, are compared to Joule dissipation and to a model of dissipation in which long-range forces lead to viscoelastic deformations.",physics
785,Compression of High-Charge Electron Bunches,"The A0 Photoinjector at Fermilab can produce high charge (10-14 nC) electron bunches of low emittance (20 pi mm-mrad for 12 nC). We have undertaken a study of the optimal compression conditions. Off-crest acceleration in the 9-cell capture cavity induces an energy-time correlation, which is rotated by the compressor chicane (4 dipoles). The bunch length is measured using streak camera images of optical transition radiation. We present measurements under various conditions, including the effect of the laser pulse length (2 ps sigma Gaussian vs. 10 ps FWHM flat top). The best compression to date is for a 13.2 nC bunch with sigma = 0.63 mm (1.89 ps), which corresponds to a peak current of 2.8 kA.",physics
786,Soft modes near the buckling transition of icosahedral shells,"Icosahedral shells undergo a buckling transition as the ratio of Young's modulus to bending stiffness increases. Strong bending stiffness favors smooth, nearly spherical shapes, while weak bending stiffness leads to a sharply faceted icosahedral shape. Based on the phonon spectrum of a simplified mass-and-spring model of the shell, we interpret the transition from smooth to faceted as a soft-mode transition. In contrast to the case of a disclinated planar network where the transition is sharply defined, the mean curvature of the sphere smooths the transitition. We define elastic susceptibilities as the response to forces applied at vertices, edges and faces of an icosahedron. At the soft-mode transition the vertex susceptibility is the largest, but as the shell becomes more faceted the edge and face susceptibilities greatly exceed the vertex susceptibility. Limiting behaviors of the susceptibilities are analyzed and related to the ridge-scaling behavior of elastic sheets. Our results apply to virus capsids, liposomes with crystalline order and other shell-like structures with icosahedral symmetry.",physics
787,On the Origin of Otho-Gardenhose Heliospheric Flux,"Parker spiral theory predicts the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) will have components of opposite polarity radially toward the Sun and tangentially antiparallel to the solar rotation (i.e. in GSE coordinates, with Bx/By<0). This theory explains the average orientation of the HMF very well but does not predict orthogardenhose (OGH) flux with BX/BY>0 that is often observed. We here study the occurrence and structure of OGH flux, as seen in near-Earth space (r=1AU) and by the Helios spacecraft at 0.29<r<1AU, in order to evaluate the contributions to OGH flux generation of the various mechanisms and factors that are not accounted for in Parker spiral theory. We study the loss of OGH flux with increasing averaging timescale between 16 seconds and 100 hours and so determine its spectrum of scale sizes. OGH flux at sunspot minimum is shown to be more common than at sunspot maximum and caused by smaller-scale structure in the HMF, with a mode temporal scale at a fixed point of 10hrs compared to 40hrs. OGH generated by rotating the HMF through the radial direction is also shown to differ in its spectrum of scale sizes from that generated by rotating the HMF through the tangential direction: the former does not contribute to the excess open heliospheric flux at a given r but the latter does. We show that roughly half of the HMF deflection from the ideal Parker spiral giving OGH at Earth occurs at r below 0.3AU. We highlight some questions which can be addressed by the Parker Solar Probe mission which will study the HMF down to r=0.046AU.",physics

We follow the evolution of the hole density with dopant concentration to highlight the limits of organic semiconductor doping. To enable the use of doping to enhance the performance of organic electronic devices, doping efficiency must be understood and improved. We report here a study using complementary optical and electrical characterization techniques, which sheds some light on the origin of this limited doping efficiency at high dopant concentration. Two doping mechanisms are considered, the direct charge transfer (DCT) and the charge transfer complex (CTC). We discuss the validity of the model involved as well as its impact on the doping efficiency.",physics
790,"The grid-dose-spreading algorithm for dose distribution calculation in
  heavy charged particle radiotherapy","A new variant of the pencil-beam (PB) algorithm for dose distribution calculation for radiotherapy with protons and heavier ions, the grid-dose spreading (GDS) algorithm, is proposed. The GDS algorithm is intrinsically faster than conventional PB algorithms due to approximations in convolution integral, where physical calculations are decoupled from simple grid-to-grid energy transfer. It was effortlessly implemented to a carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning system to enable realistic beam blurring in the field, which was absent with the broad-beam (BB) algorithm. For a typical prostate treatment, the slowing factor of the GDS algorithm relative to the BB algorithm was 1.4, which is a great improvement over the conventional PB algorithms with a typical slowing factor of several tens. The GDS algorithm is mathematically equivalent to the PB algorithm for horizontal and vertical coplanar beams commonly used in carbon-ion radiotherapy while dose deformation within the size of the pristine spread occurs for angled beams, which was within 3 mm for a single proton pencil beam of $30^\circ$ incidence, and needs to be assessed against the clinical requirements and tolerances in practical situations.",physics

This asymmetry was predicted by Richards and Wolf [Proc.R.Soc.London A, 253, 358 (1959)] and can only be measured when a polarization insensitive sensor is placed in the focal region. We used a specially modified photodiode in a knife edge type set up to obtain highly resolved images of the total electric energy density distribution at the focus. The results are in good agreement with the predictions of a vectorial focussing theory.",physics
794,Quantization of energy and writhe in self-repelling knots,"Probably the most natural energy functional to be considered for knotted strings is the one given by the electrostatic repulsion. In the absence of counter-charges, a charged, knotted string evolving along the energy gradient of electrostatic repulsion would progressively tighten its knotted domain into a point on a perfectly circular string. However, in the presence of charge screeningthe self-repelling knotted strings can get stabilised. It is known that energy functionals in which repulsive forces between repelling charges grow inversely proportional to the third or higher power of their relative distance stabilise self-repelling knots. Especially interesting is the case of the third power since the repulsive energy becomes scale invariant and does not change upon Moebius transformations (reflections in spheres) of knotted trajectories. We observe here thatknots minimising their repulsive Moebius energy show quantization of the energy and writhe (measure of chirality) within several tested families of knots.",physics
795,Statistical mechanics of columnar DNA assemblies,"Many physical systems can be mapped onto solved or ""solvable"" models of magnetism. In this work, we have mapped the statistical mechanics of columnar phases of ideally helical rigid DNA -- subject to the earlier found unusual, frustrated pair potential [A. A. Kornyshev and S. Leikin, J. Chem. Phys. 107, 3656 (1997)] -- onto an exotic, unknown variant of the XY model on a fixed or restructurable lattice. Here the role of the 'spin' is played by the azimuthal orientation of the molecules. We have solved this model using a Hartree-Fock approximation, ground state calculations, and finite temperature Monte Carlo simulations. We have found peculiar spin order transitions, which may also be accompanied by positional restructuring, from hexagonal to rhombohedric lattices. Some of these have been experimentally observed in dense columnar aggregates. Note that DNA columnar phases are of great interest in biophysical research, not only because they are a useful in vitro tool for the study of DNA condensation, but also since these structures have been detected in living matter. Within the approximations made, our study provides insight into the statistical mechanics of these systems.",physics

798,"Space Weathering on Near-Earth Objects investigated by neutral-particle
  detection","The ion-sputtering (IS) process is active in many planetary environments in the Solar System where plasma precipitates directly on the surface (for instance, Mercury, Moon, Europa). In particular, solar-wind sputtering is one of the most important agents for the surface erosion of a Near-Earth Object (NEO), acting together with other surface release processes, such as Photon Stimulated Desorption (PSD), Thermal Desorption (TD) and Micrometeoroid Impact Vaporization (MIV). The energy distribution of the IS-released neutrals peaks at a few eVs and extends up to hundreds of eVs. Since all other release processes produce particles of lower energies, the presence of neutral atoms in the energy range above 10 eV and below a few keVs (Sputtered High-Energy Atoms - SHEA) identifies the IS process. SHEA easily escape from the NEO, due to NEO's extremely weak gravity. Detection and analysis of SHEA will give important information on surface-loss processes as well as on surface elemental composition. The investigation of the active release processes, as a function of the external conditions and the NEO surface properties, is crucial for obtaining a clear view of the body's present loss rate as well as for getting clues on its evolution, which depends significantly on space weather. In this work, an attempt to analyze the processes that take place on the surface of these small airless bodies, as a result of their exposure to the space environment, has been realized. For this reason a new space weathering model (Space Weathering on NEO - SPAWN), is presented. Moreover, an instrument concept of a neutral-particle analyzer specifically designed for the measurement of neutral density and the detection of SHEA from a NEO is proposed",physics

801,"Inference of Markovian Properties of Molecular Sequences from NGS Data
  and Applications to Comparative Genomics","Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies generate large amounts of short read data for many different organisms. The fact that NGS reads are generally short makes it challenging to assemble the reads and reconstruct the original genome sequence. For clustering genomes using such NGS data, word-count based alignment-free sequence comparison is a promising approach, but for this approach, the underlying expected word counts are essential.   A plausible model for this underlying distribution of word counts is given through modelling the DNA sequence as a Markov chain (MC). For single long sequences, efficient statistics are available to estimate the order of MCs and the transition probability matrix for the sequences. As NGS data do not provide a single long sequence, inference methods on Markovian properties of sequences based on single long sequences cannot be directly used for NGS short read data.   Here we derive a normal approximation for such word counts. We also show that the traditional Chi-square statistic has an approximate gamma distribution, using the Lander-Waterman model for physical mapping. We propose several methods to estimate the order of the MC based on NGS reads and evaluate them using simulations. We illustrate the applications of our results by clustering genomic sequences of several vertebrate and tree species based on NGS reads using alignment-free sequence dissimilarity measures. We find that the estimated order of the MC has a considerable effect on the clustering results, and that the clustering results that use a MC of the estimated order give a plausible clustering of the species.",q-bio

  hydrophobicity forces","The 16-22 amino acid fragment of the beta-amyloid peptide associated with the Alzheimer's disease, Abeta, is capable of forming amyloid fibrils. Here we study the aggregation mechanism of Abeta(16-22) peptides by unbiased thermodynamic simulations at the atomic level for systems of one, three and six Abeta(16-22) peptides. We find that the isolated Abeta(16-22) peptide is mainly a random coil in the sense that both the alpha-helix and beta-strand contents are low, whereas the three- and six-chain systems form aggregated structures with a high beta-sheet content. Furthermore, in agreement with experiments on Abeta(16-22) fibrils, we find that large parallel beta-sheets are unlikely to form. For the six-chain system, the aggregated structures can have many different shapes, but certain particularly stable shapes can be identified.",q-bio
803,Dynamic Studies of Scaffold-dependent Mating Pathway in Yeast,"The mating pathway in \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} is one of the best understood signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes. It transmits the mating signal from plasma membrane into the nucleus through the G-protein coupled receptor and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. According to the current understandings of the mating pathway, we construct a system of ordinary differential equations to describe the process. Our model is consistent with a wide range of experiments, indicating that it captures some main characteristics of the signal transduction along the pathway. Investigation with the model reveals that the shuttling of the scaffold protein and the dephosphorylation of kinases involved in the MAPK cascade cooperate to regulate the response upon pheromone induction and to help preserving the fidelity of the mating signaling. We explored factors affecting the dose-response curves of this pathway and found that both negative feedback and concentrations of the proteins involved in the MAPK cascade play crucial role. Contrary to some other MAPK systems where signaling sensitivity is being amplified successively along the cascade, here the mating signal is transmitted through the cascade in an almost linear fashion.",q-bio
804,"Simulations of tubulin sheet polymers as possible structural
  intermediates in microtubule assembly","The microtubule assembly process has been extensively studied, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. The structure of an artificially generated sheet polymer that alternates two types of lateral contacts and that directly converts into microtubules, has been proposed to correspond to the intermediate sheet structure observed during microtubule assembly. We have studied the self-assembly process of GMPCPP tubulins into sheet and microtubule structures using thermodynamic analysis and stochastic simulations. With the novel assumptions that tubulins can laterally interact in two different forms, and allosterically affect neighboring lateral interactions, we can explain existing experimental observations. At low temperature, the allosteric effect results in the observed sheet structure with alternating lateral interactions as the thermodynamically most stable form. At normal microtubule assembly temperature, our work indicates that a class of sheet structures resembling those observed at low temperature is transiently trapped as an intermediate during the assembly process. This work may shed light on the tubulin molecular interactions, and the role of sheet formation during microtubule assembly.",q-bio
805,The Shared Reward Dilemma,"One of the most direct human mechanisms of promoting cooperation is rewarding it. We study the effect of sharing a reward among cooperators in the most stringent form of social dilemma, namely the Prisoner's Dilemma. Specifically, for a group of players that collect payoffs by playing a pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma game with their partners, we consider an external entity that distributes a fixed reward equally among all cooperators. Thus, individuals confront a new dilemma: on the one hand, they may be inclined to choose the shared reward despite the possibility of being exploited by defectors; on the other hand, if too many players do that, cooperators will obtain a poor reward and defectors will outperform them. By appropriately tuning the amount to be shared a vast variety of scenarios arises, including traditional ones in the study of cooperation as well as more complex situations where unexpected behavior can occur. We provide a complete classification of the equilibria of the $n$-player game as well as of its evolutionary dynamics.",q-bio
806,"Rapid divergence of the ecdysone receptor in Diptera and Lepidoptera
  suggests coevolution between ECR and USP-RXR","Ecdysteroid hormones are major regulators in reproduction and development of insects, including larval molts and metamorphosis. The functional ecdysone receptor is a heterodimer of ECR (NR1H1) and USP-RXR (NR2B4), which is the orthologue of vertebrate retinoid X receptors (RXR alpha, beta, gamma). Both proteins belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, ligand-dependent transcription factors that share two conserved domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). In order to gain further insight into the evolution of metamorphosis and gene regulation by ecdysone in arthropods, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of both partners of the heterodimer ECR/USP-RXR. Overall, 38 USP-RXR and 19 ECR protein sequences, from 33 species, have been used for this analysis. Interestingly, sequence alignments and structural comparisons reveal high divergence rates, for both ECR and USP-RXR, specifically among Diptera and Lepidoptera. The most impressive differences affect the ligand-binding domain of USP-RXR. In addition, ECR sequences show variability in other domains, namely the DNA-binding and the carboxy-terminal F domains. Our data provide the first evidence that ECR and USP-RXR may have coevolved during holometabolous insect diversification, leading to a functional divergence of the ecdysone receptor. These results have general implications on fundamental aspects of insect development, evolution of nuclear receptors, and the design of specific insecticides.",q-bio
807,Can the light be used to treat obesity and diabetes?,The treatment of obesity and diabetes remains a challenge and the biological mechanisms of these diseases are still not fully understood. Diabetes and obesity are associated with increased risk of the development of cardiovascular complications and there is an urgent need to find novel therapeutic approaches for treating obesity and diabetes. Currently there are several approaches to treat these diseases. Among them chemical uncouplers could be used as an effective treatment for obesity but the dangerous side effects of these compounds has limited their use in vivo. Here we propose a novel theoretical model based on the mechanism of action of chemical uncouplers: the thermogenin-like system (TLS). The TLS may be used in vivo to reproduce the mechanism of action of chemical uncouplers but without their dangerous side effects.,q-bio

  animal species","Animal hair examination at a criminal scene may provide valuable information in forensic investigations. However, local reference databases for animal hair identification are rare. In the present study, we provide differential histological analysis of hair of some domestic animals in Upper Egypt. For this purpose, guard hair of large ruminants (buffalo, camel and cow), small ruminants (sheep and goat), equine (horse and donkey) and canine (dog and cat) were collected and comparative analysis was performed by light microscopy. Based on the hair cuticle scale pattern, type and diameter of the medulla, and the pigmentation, characteristic differential features of each animal species were identified. The cuticle scale pattern was imbricate in all tested animals except in donkey, in which coronal scales were identified. The cuticle scale margin type, shape and the distance in between were characteristic for each animal species. The hair medulla was continuous in most of the tested animal species with the exception of sheep, in which fragmental medulla was detected. The diameter of the hair medulla and the margins differ according to the animal species. Hair shaft pigmentation were not detected in all tested animals with the exception of camel and buffalo, in which granules and streak-like pigmentation were detected. In conclusion, the present study provides a first-step towards preparation of a complete local reference database for animal hair identification that can be used in forensic investigations.",q-bio

  supercoiling-sensitive genes: how to relate microarray expression data with
  genomic sequences","The level of supercoiling in the chromosome can affect gene expression. To clarify the basis of supercoiling sensitivity, we analyzed the structural features of nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of promoters for the genes with expression enhanced and decreased in response to loss of chromosomal supercoiling in E. coli. Fourier analysis of promoter sequences for supercoiling-sensitive genes reveals the tendency in selection of sequences with helical periodicities close to 10 nt for relaxation-induced genes and to 11 nt for relaxation-repressed genes. The helical periodicities in the subsets of promoters recognized by RNA polymerase with different sigma factors were also studied. A special procedure was developed for study of correlations between the intensities of periodicities in promoter sequences and the expression levels of corresponding genes. Significant correlations of expression with the AT content and with AT periodicities about 10, 11, and 50 nt indicate their role in regulation of supercoiling-sensitive genes.",q-bio

811,Model for solvent viscosity effect on enzymatic reactions,Why reaction rate constants for enzymatic reactions are typically inversely proportional to fractional power exponents of solvent viscosity remains to be already a thirty years old puzzle. Available interpretations of the phenomenon invoke to either a modification of 1. the conventional Kramers' theory or that of 2. the Stokes law. We show that there is an alternative interpretation of the phenomenon at which neither of these modifications is in fact indispensable. We reconcile 1. and 2. with the experimentally observable dependence. We assume that an enzyme solution in solvent with or without cosolvent molecules is an ensemble of samples with different values of the viscosity for the movement of the system along the reaction coordinate. We assume that this viscosity consists of the contribution with the weight $q$ from cosolvent molecules and that with the weight $1-q$ from protein matrix and solvent molecules. We introduce heterogeneity in our system with the help of a distribution over the weight $q$. We verify the obtained solution of the integral equation for the unknown function of the distribution by direct substitution. All parameters of the model are related to experimentally observable values. General formalism is exemplified by the analysis of literature experimental data for oxygen escape from hemerythin.,q-bio
812,Chirality in a quaternionic representation of the genetic code,"A quaternionic representation of the genetic code, previously reported by the authors, is updated in order to incorporate chirality of nucleotide bases and amino acids. The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a prime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with each codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer quaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of the standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show the advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn, associated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type quaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order quaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the tertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this context, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the set of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of subsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by putting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D and L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil, respectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we define functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer quaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a given D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that one corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for the amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to describe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.",q-bio
813,Rank abundance relations in evolutionary dynamics of random replicators,"We present a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics description of rank abundance relations (RAR) in random community models of ecology. Specifically, we study a multi-species replicator system with quenched random interaction matrices. We here consider symmetric interactions as well as asymmetric and anti-symmetric cases. RARs are obtained analytically via a generating functional analysis, describing fixed-point states of the system in terms of a small set of order parameters, and in dependence on the symmetry or otherwise of interactions and on the productivity of the community. Our work is an extension of Tokita [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93} 178102 (2004)], where the case of symmetric interactions was considered within an equilibrium setup. The species abundance distribution in our model come out as truncated normal distributions or transformations thereof and, in some case, are similar to left-skewed distributions observed in ecology. We also discuss the interaction structure of the resulting food-web of stable species at stationarity, cases of heterogeneous co-operation pressures as well as effects of finite system size and of higher-order interactions.",q-bio
814,"Effect of In-vivo Heat Challenge on Physiological Parameters and
  Function of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Immune Phenotyped Dairy
  Cattle","The frequency of heat waves are increasing due to climate change, which leads to an increase in the occurrence of heat stress in dairy cattle. Previous studies have shown that dairy cattle identified as high immune responders have a reduced incidence of disease and improved vaccine response compared to average and low responders. Additionally, it has been observed that when cells from immune phenotyped cattle are exposed to in-vitro heat challenge, high immune responders exhibit increased heat tolerance compared to average and low responders. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate physiological parameters and the function of blood mononuclear cells in immune phenotyped dairy cattle exposed to in-vivo heat challenge. A total of 24 immune phenotyped lactating dairy cattle (8 high, 8 average and 8 low) were housed in the tie-stall area of the barn and exposed to an in-vivo heat challenge for 4 hours on 2 subsequent days. Blood samples were taken both pre- and post-challenge and respiration rates and rectal temperatures were recorded. Temperature and humidity measurements were taken in correspondence with all respiration rate and rectal temperature measurements to calculate the temperature humidity index. Blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood collected pre and post challenge and the concentration of heat shock protein 70 and cell proliferation were assessed. Results showed that average and low responders had significantly greater respiration rates compared to high responders at a temperature humidity index of 77 and above. High responders had a higher heat shock protein 70 concentration and greater cell proliferation after in-vivo heat challenge compared to average and low responders. These results paralleled those found during in-vitro heat challenge confirming that high responders may be more resilient to heat stress compared average and low responders.",q-bio
815,"Associative memory of phase-coded spatiotemporal patterns in leaky
  Integrate and Fire networks","We study the collective dynamics of a Leaky Integrate and Fire network in which precise relative phase relationship of spikes among neurons are stored, as attractors of the dynamics, and selectively replayed at differentctime scales. Using an STDP-based learning process, we store in the connectivity several phase-coded spike patterns, and we find that, depending on the excitability of the network, different working regimes are possible, with transient or persistent replay activity induced by a brief signal. We introduce an order parameter to evaluate the similarity between stored and recalled phase-coded pattern, and measure the storage capacity. Modulation of spiking thresholds during replay changes the frequency of the collective oscillation or the number of spikes per cycle, keeping preserved the phases relationship. This allows a coding scheme in which phase, rate and frequency are dissociable. Robustness with respect to noise and heterogeneity of neurons parameters is studied, showing that, since dynamics is a retrieval process, neurons preserve stablecprecise phase relationship among units, keeping a unique frequency of oscillation, even in noisy conditions and with heterogeneity of internal parameters of the units.",q-bio
816,Microtubule dynamics depart from wormlike chain model,"Thermal shape fluctuations of grafted microtubules were studied using high resolution particle tracking of attached fluorescent beads. First mode relaxation times were extracted from the mean square displacement in the transverse coordinate. For microtubules shorter than 10 um, the relaxation times were found to follow an L^2 dependence instead of L^4 as expected from the standard wormlike chain model. This length dependence is shown to result from a complex length dependence of the bending stiffness which can be understood as a result of the molecular architecture of microtubules. For microtubules shorter than 5 um, high drag coefficients indicate contributions from internal friction to the fluctuation dynamics.",q-bio
817,"Loss of AP-3 function affects spontaneous and evoked release at
  hippocampal mossy fiber synapses","Synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis mediating neurotransmitter release occurs spontaneously at low intraterminal calcium concentrations and is stimulated by a rise in intracellular calcium. Exocytosis is compensated for by the reformation of vesicles at plasma membrane and endosomes. Although the adaptor complex AP-3 was proposed to be involved in the formation of SVs from endosomes, whether its function has an indirect effect on exocytosis remains unknown. Using mocha mice, which are deficient in functional AP-3, we identify an AP-3-dependent tetanus neurotoxin-resistant asynchronous release that can be evoked at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses. Presynaptic targeting of the tetanus neurotoxin-resistant vesicle soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) tetanus neurotoxin-insensitive vesicle-associated membrane protein (TI-VAMP) is lost in mocha hippocampal MF terminals, whereas the localization of synaptobrevin 2 is unaffected. In addition, quantal release in mocha cultures is more frequent and more sensitive to sucrose. We conclude that lack of AP-3 results in more constitutive secretion and loss of an asynchronous evoked release component, suggesting an important function of AP-3 in regulating SV exocytosis at MF terminals.",q-bio

  homologous organ conservation score, a new benchmark method for quality
  control metrics","Motivation: Microarray results accumulated in public repositories are widely re-used in meta-analytical studies and secondary databases. The quality of the data obtained with this technology varies from experiment to experiment and efficient method for quality assessment is neces-sary to ensure their reliability. Results: The lack of a good benchmark has hampered evaluation of existing methods for quality control. In this study we propose a new inde-pendent quality metric that is based on evolutionary conservation of expression profiles. We show, using 11 large organ-specific datasets, that IQRray, a new quality metrics developed by us, exhibits the highest correlation with this reference metric, among 14 metrics tested. IQRray outperforms other methods in identification of poor quality arrays in dataset composed of arrays from many independent experiments. In con-trast, the performance of methods designed for detecting outliers in a single experiment like NUSE and RLE was low because of the inability of these method to detect datasets containing only low quality arrays, and the fact that the scores cannot be directly compared between ex-periments.

Modelling this process can provide novel insights into development and the principles that orchestrate the developmental processes. This chapter focusses on the mathematical description and numerical simulation of developmental processes. In particular, we discuss the mathematical representation of morphogen and tissue dynamics on static and grow- ing domains, as well as the corresponding tissue mechanics. In addition, we give an overview of numerical methods that are routinely used to solve the resulting systems of partial differential equations. These include the finite element method and the Lattice Boltzmann method for the discretisation as well as the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method and the Diffuse-Domain method to numerically treat deforming domains.",q-bio

  during incubation","Immunity is hypothesized to share limited resources with other physiological functions and this may partly account for the fitness costs of reproduction. Previous studies have shown that the acquired immunity of female common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima) is suppressed during their incubation, during which they entirely fast. Corticosterone was proposed to be an underlying physiological mechanism for such immunosuppression. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the effects of exogenous corticosterone on acquired immunity in captive eiders. To this end, females were implanted with corticosterone pellets at different stages of their incubation fast. We measured total immunoglobulin levels, T-cell-mediated immune response, body mass and corticosterone levels in these females and compared them with those of control females prior to and after manipulation (i.e. corticosterone pellet implantation). To mimic corticosterone effects on body mass, we experimentally extended fasting duration in a group of females termed ;late fasters'...",q-bio
822,"Toward tunable RNA thermo-switches for temperature dependent gene
  expression","RNA thermometers are mRNA strands with a temperature dependent secondary structure: depending on the spatial conformation, the mRNA strand can get translated (on-state) or can be inaccessible for ribosomes binding (off-state). These have been found in a number of microorganisms (mainly pathogens), where they are used to adaptively regulate the gene expression, in response to changes in the environmental temperature. Besides naturally occurring RNA thermometers, synthetic RNA thermometers have been recently designed by modifying their natural counterparts (Hofacker et al., 2003). The newly designed RNA thermometers are simpler, and exhibit a sharper switching between off- and on-states. However, the proposed trial-and-error design procedure has not been algorithmically formalized, and the switching temperature is rigidly determined by the natural RNA thermometer used as template for the design.   We developed a general algorithmic procedure (consensus distribution) for the design of RNA thermo-switches with a tunable switching temperature that can be decided in advance by the designer. A software tool with a user friendly GUI has been written to automate the design of RNA thermo-switches with a desired threshold temperature. Starting from a natural template, a new RNA thermometer has been designed by our method for a new desired threshold temperature of 32C. The designed RNA thermo-switch has been experimentally validated by using it to control the expression of lucifarase. A 9.2 fold increase of luminescence has been observed between 30C and 37C, whereas between 20C and 30C the luminescence increase is less than 3-fold.   This work represents a first step towards the design of flexible and tunable RNA thermometers that can be used for a precise control of gene expression without the need of external chemicals and possibly for temperature measurements at a nano-scale resolution.",q-bio

  COVID-19","Given the existing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is critical to systematically study the interactions between hosts and coronaviruses including SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov, and SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19). We first created four host-pathogen interaction (HPI)-Outcome postulates, and generated a HPI-Outcome model as the basis for understanding host-coronavirus interactions (HCI) and their relations with the disease outcomes. We hypothesized that ontology can be used as an integrative platform to classify and analyze HCI and disease outcomes. Accordingly, we annotated and categorized different coronaviruses, hosts, and phenotypes using ontologies and identified their relations. Various COVID-19 phenotypes are hypothesized to be caused by the backend HCI mechanisms. To further identify the causal HCI-outcome relations, we collected 35 experimentally-verified HCI protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and applied literature mining to identify additional host PPIs in response to coronavirus infections. The results were formulated in a logical ontology representation for integrative HCI-outcome understanding. Using known PPIs as baits, we also developed and applied a domain-inferred prediction method to predict new PPIs and identified their pathological targets on multiple organs. Overall, our proposed ontology-based integrative framework combined with computational predictions can be used to support fundamental understanding of the intricate interactions between human patients and coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) and their association with various disease outcomes.",q-bio
824,Observation of the DNA ion-phosphate vibrations,"The low-frequency Raman spectra of Na-and Cs-DNA water solutions have been studied to determine the mode of counterion vibrations with respect to phosphate groups of the DNA double helix. The obtained spectra are characterized by the water band near 180 cm-1 and by several DNA bands near 100 cm-1. The main difference between Na- and Cs-DNA spectra is observed in case of the band 100 cm-1. In Cs-DNA spectra this band has about twice higher intensity than in Na-DNA spectra. The comparison of obtained spectra with the calculated frequencies of Na- and Cs-DNA conformational vibrations [Perepelytsya S.M., Volkov S.N. Eur. Phys. J. E. 24, 261 (2007)] show that the band 100 cm-1 in the spectra of Cs-DNA is formed by the modes of both H-bond stretching vibrations and vibrations of caesium counterions, while in Na-DNA spectra the band 100 cm-1 is formed by the mode of H-bond stretching vibrations only. The modes of sodium counterion vibrations have a frequency 180 cm-1, and they do not rise above the water band. Thus, the increase in intensity of the band 100 cm-1 in the spectra of Cs-DNA as compared with Na-DNA is caused by the mode of ion-phosphate vibrations.",q-bio
825,"Passive Cervical Spine Ligaments Provide Stability during Head Impacts
  in Vivo","It has long been suggested that neck muscle strength and anticipatory cocontraction can decrease head motions during head impacts. Here, we quantify the relative angular impulse contributions of neck soft tissue to head stabilization using a musculoskeletal model with Hill-type muscles and rate-dependent ligaments. We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion mild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or cocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated angular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during head impact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase, active musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This was reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase, active musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments provided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The redistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle dependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared to active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively greater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectiveness of muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.",q-bio

Our algorithm yields a unique contact map for all 221 globular structures of PDBselect25 of length $N \le 120$. We also show that the reconstructed contact maps allow in turn for the accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional structure. These results indicate that the reduced vectorial representation provided by the principal eigenvector of the contact map is equivalent to the protein structure itself. This representation is expected to provide a useful tool in bioinformatics algorithms for protein structure comparison and alignment, as well as a promising intermediate step towards protein structure prediction.",q-bio
827,"SEK: Sparsity exploiting $k$-mer-based estimation of bacterial community
  composition","Motivation: Estimation of bacterial community composition from a high-throughput sequenced sample is an important task in metagenomics applications. Since the sample sequence data typically harbors reads of variable lengths and different levels of biological and technical noise, accurate statistical analysis of such data is challenging. Currently popular estimation methods are typically very time consuming in a desktop computing environment.   Results: Using sparsity enforcing methods from the general sparse signal processing field (such as compressed sensing), we derive a solution to the community composition estimation problem by a simultaneous assignment of all sample reads to a pre-processed reference database. A general statistical model based on kernel density estimation techniques is introduced for the assignment task and the model solution is obtained using convex optimization tools. Further, we design a greedy algorithm solution for a fast solution. Our approach offers a reasonably fast community composition estimation method which is shown to be more robust to input data variation than a recently introduced related method.

  Human and Yeast Cells","Mutations in the MTM1 gene, encoding the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin, are responsible for the X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM) or X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM). The MTM1 gene was first identified in 1996 and its function as a PtdIns3P and PtdIns(,5)P2 phosphatase was discovered in 2000. In recent years, very important progress has been made to set up good models to study MTM1 and the XLCNM disease such as knockout or knockin mice, the Labrador Retriever dog, the zebrafish and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These helped to better understand the cellular function of MTM1 and of its four conserved domains: PH-GRAM (Pleckstrin Homology-Glucosyltransferase, Rab-like GTPase Activator and Myotubularin), RID (Rac1-Induced recruitment Domain), PTP/DSP (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase/Dual-Specificity Phosphatase) and SID (SET-protein Interaction Domain).

Prediction of transcription factor binding sites represents an important tool for elucidating regulatory networks, and has been conducted in multiple genera of plant pathogenic bacteria for the purpose of better understanding mechanisms of survival and pathogenesis. The major categories of transcription factor binding sites that have been characterized are reviewed here with emphasis on in silico methods used for site identification and challenges therein, their applicability to different types of sequence datasets, and insights into mechanisms of virulence and survival that have been gained through binding site mapping.

  Environment","The dynamics of gene transcription is tightly regulated in eukaryotes. Recent experiments have revealed various kinds of transcriptional dynamics, such as RNA polymerase II pausing, that involves regulation at the transcription initiation stage, and the choice of different regulation pattern is closely related to the physiological functions of the target gene. Here we consider a simplified model of transcription initiation, a process including the assembly of transcription complex and the pausing and releasing of the RNA polymerase II. Focusing on the collective behaviors on a population level, we explore potential regulatory functions this model can offer. These functions include fast and synchronized response to environmental change, or long-term memory about the transcriptional status. As a proof of concept we also show that, by selecting different control mechanisms cells can adapt to different environments. These findings may help us better understand the design principles of transcriptional regulation.",q-bio

833,"Heterogeneous Cell Population Dynamics: Equation-Free Uncertainty
  Quantification Computations","We propose a computational approach to modeling the collective dynamics of populations of coupled heterogeneous biological oscillators. In contrast to Monte Carlo simulation, this approach utilizes generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) to represent random properties of the population, thus reducing the dynamics of ensembles of oscillators to dynamics of their (typically significantly fewer) representative gPC coefficients. Equation-Free (EF) methods are employed to efficiently evolve these gPC coefficients in time and compute their coarse-grained stationary state and/or limit cycle solutions, circumventing the derivation of explicit, closed-form evolution equations. Ensemble realizations of the oscillators and their statistics can be readily reconstructed from these gPC coefficients. We apply this methodology to the synchronization of yeast glycolytic oscillators coupled by the membrane exchange of an intracellular metabolite. The heterogeneity consists of a single random parameter, which accounts for glucose influx into a cell, with a Gaussian distribution over the population. Coarse projective integration is used to accelerate the evolution of the population statistics in time. Coarse fixed-point algorithms in conjunction with a Poincar\'e return map are used to compute oscillatory solutions for the cell population and to quantify their stability.",q-bio
834,Fundamental Dynamic Units: Feedforward Networks and Adjustable Gates,"The activation/repression of a given gene is typically regulated by multiple transcription factors (TFs) that bind at the gene regulatory region and recruit RNA polymerase (RNAP). The interactions between the promoter region and TFs and between different TFs specify the dynamic responses of the gene under different physiological conditions. By choosing specific regulatory interactions with up to three transcription factors, we designed several functional motifs, each of which is shown to perform a certain function and can be integrated into larger networks. We analyzed three kinds of networks: (i) Motifs derived from incoherent feedforward motifs, which behave as `amplitude filters', or `concentration detectors'. These motifs respond maximally to input transcription factors with concentrations within a certain range. From these motifs homeostatic and pulse generating networks are derived. (ii) Tunable network motifs, which can behave as oscillators or switches for low and high concentrations of an input transcription factor, respectively. (iii) Transcription factor controlled adjustable gates, which switch between AND/OR gate characteristics, depending on the concentration of the input transcription factor. This study has demonstrated the utility of feedforward networks and the flexibility of specific transcriptional binding kinetics in generating new novel behaviors. The flexibility of feedforward networks as dynamic units may explain the apparent frequency that such motifs are found in real biological networks.",q-bio
835,Generalized sensitivity functions for size-structured population models,"Size-structured population models provide a popular means to mathematically describe phenomena such as bacterial aggregation, schooling fish, and planetesimal evolution. For parameter estimation, generalized sensitivity functions (GSFs) provide a tool that quantifies the impact of data from specific regions of the experimental domain. These functions help identify the most relevant data subdomains, which enhances the optimization of experimental design. To our knowledge, GSFs have not been used in the partial differential equation (PDE) realm, so we provide a novel PDE extension of the discrete and continuous ordinary differential equation (ODE) concepts of Thomaseth and Cobelli and Banks et al. respectively. We analyze the GSFs in the context of size-structured population models, and specifically analyze the Smoluchowski coagulation equation to determine the most relevant time and volume domains for three, distinct aggregation kernels. Finally, we provide evidence that parameter estimation for the Smoluchowski coagulation equation does not require post-gelation data.",q-bio

The objective of this study was to specify the level of motor activity of pregnant sows housed in groups in different housing systems. Eleven commercial farms were selected for this study. Four housing systems were represented: small groups of five to seven sows (SG), free access stalls (FS) with exercise area, electronic sow feeder with a stable group (ESFsta) or a dynamic group (ESFdyn). Ten sows in mid-gestation were observed in each farm. The observations of motor activity were made for 6 hours at the first meal or at the start of the feeding sequence, two consecutive days and at regular intervals of 4 minutes. The results show that the motor activity of group-housed sows depends on the housing system. The activity is higher with the ESFdyn system (standing: 55.7%), sows are less active in the SG system (standing: 26.5%), and FS system is intermediate. The distance traveled by sows in ESF system is linked to a larger area available. Thus, sows travel an average of 362 m $\pm$ 167 m in the ESFdyn system with an average available surface of 446 m${}^2$ whereas sows in small groups travel 50 m $\pm$ 15 m for 15 m${}^2$ available.",q-bio
837,"A Deterministic Mathematical Model for Bidirectional Excluded Flow with
  Langmuir Kinetics","In many important cellular processes, including mRNA translation, gene transcription, phosphotransfer, and intracellular transport, biological ""particles"" move along some kind of ""tracks"". The motion of these particles can be modeled as a one-dimensional movement along an ordered sequence of sites. The biological particles (e.g., ribosomes, RNAPs, phosphate groups, motor proteins) have volume and cannot surpass one another. In some cases, there is a preferred direction of movement along the track, but in general the movement may be two-directional, and furthermore the particles may attach or detach from various regions along the tracks (e.g. ribosomes may drop off the mRNA molecule before reaching a stop codon). We derive a new deterministic mathematical model for such transport phenomena that may be interpreted as the dynamic mean-field approximation of an important model from mechanical statistics called the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with Langmuir kinetics. Using tools from the theory of monotone dynamical systems and contraction theory we show that the model admits a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. This means that the occupancy in all the sites along the lattice converges to a steady-state value that depends on the parameters but not on the initial conditions. We also show that the model entrains (or phase locks) to periodic excitations in any of its forward, backward, attachment, or detachment rates. We demonstrate an application of this phenomenological transport model for analyzing the effect of ribosome drop off in mRNA translation. One may perhaps expect that drop off from a jammed site may increase the total flow by reducing congestion. Our results show that this is not true. Drop off has a substantial effect on the flow, yet always leads to a reduction in the steady-state protein production rate.",q-bio
838,Cell Cycling Models of Carcinogenesis: A Complex Systems Analysis,"A new approach to the modular, complex systems analysis of nonlinear dynamics in cell cycling network transformations involved in carcinogenesis is proposed. Carcinogenesis is a complex process that involves dynamically inter-connected biomolecules in the intercellular, membrane, cytosolic, nuclear and nucleolar compartments that form numerous inter-related pathways. One such family of pathways contains the cell cyclins. Cyclins are proteins that link several critical pro-apoptotic and other cell cycling/division components, including the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and its product, the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen), Rb, mdm2, c-Myc, p21, p27, Bax, Bad and Bcl-2, which all play major roles in neoplastic transformation of many tissues.

  malformations","Members of the large family of Hox transcription factors are encoded by genes whose tightly regulated expression in development and in space within different embryonic tissues confer positional identity from the neck to the tips of the limbs. Many structures of the face, head, and heart10 develop from cell populations expressing few or no Hox genes. Hoxb1 is the member of its chromosomal cluster expressed in the most rostral domain during vertebrate development, but never by the multipotent neural crest cell population anterior to the cerebellum. We have developed a novel floxed transgenic mouse line, CAG-Hoxb1,-EGFP (CAG-Hoxb1), which upon recombination by Cre recombinase conditionally induces robust Hoxb1 and eGFP overexpression. When induced within the neural crest lineage, pups die at birth. A variable phenotype develops from E11.5 on, associating frontonasal hypoplasia/aplasia, micrognathia/agnathia, major ocular and forebrain anomalies, and cardiovascular malformations. Neural crest derivatives in the body appear unaffected. Transcription of effectors of developmental signaling pathways (Bmp, Shh, Vegfa) and transcription factors (Pax3, Sox9) is altered in mutants. These outcomes emphasize that repression of Hoxb1, along with other paralog group 1 and 2 Hox genes, is strictly necessary in anterior cephalic NC for craniofacial, visual, auditory, and cardiovascular development.",q-bio
840,"Biological mechanism and identifiability of a class of stationary
  conductance model for Voltage-gated Ion channels","The physiology of voltage gated ion channels is complex and insights into their gating mechanism is incomplete. Their function is best represented by Markov models with relatively large number of distinct states that are connected by thermodynamically feasible transitions. On the other hand, popular models such as the one of Hodgkin and Huxley have empirical assumptions that are generally unrealistic. Experimental protocols often dictate the number of states in proposed Markov models, thus creating disagreements between various observations on the same channel. Here we aim to propose a limit to the minimum number of states required to model ion channels by employing a paradigm to define stationary conductance in a class of ion-channels. A simple expression is generated using concepts in elementary thermodynamics applied to protein conformational transitions. Further, it matches well many published channel current-voltage characteristics and parameters of the model are found to be identifiable and easily determined from usual experimental protocols.",q-bio
841,"Toward a better analysis of secreted proteins: the example of the
  myeloid cells secretome","The analysis of secreted proteins represents a challenge for current proteomics techniques. Proteins are usually secreted at low concentrations in the culture media, which makes their recovery difficult. In addition, culture media are rich in salts and other compounds interfering with most proteomics techniques, which makes selective precipitation of proteins almost mandatory for a correct subsequent proteomics analysis. Last but not least, the non-secreted proteins liberated in the culture medium upon lysis of a few dead cells heavily contaminate the so-called secreted proteins preparations. Several techniques have been used in the past for concentration of proteins secreted in culture media. These techniques present several drawbacks, such as coprecipitation of salts or poor yields at low protein concentrations. Improved techniques based on carrier-assisted trichloroacetic acid precipitation are described and discussed in this paper. These techniques have been used to analyse the secretome of myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) and enabled to analyze proteins secreted at concentrations close to 1 ng/ml, thereby allowing to detect some of the cytokines (TNF, IL-12) secreted by the myeloid cells upon activation by bacterial products.",q-bio
842,"Local dynamic stability of treadmill walking: intrasession and
  week-to-week repeatability","Repetitive falls degrade the quality of life of elderly people and of patients suffering of various neurological disorders. In order to prevent falls while walking, one should rely on relevant early indicators of impaired dynamic balance. The local dynamic stability (LDS) represents the sensitivity of gait to small perturbations: divergence exponents (maximal Lyapunov exponents) assess how fast a dynamical system diverges from neighbor points. Although numerous findings attest the validity of LDS as a fall risk index, reliability results are still sparse. The present study explores the intrasession and intersession repeatability of gait LDS using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Ninety-five healthy individuals performed 5min. treadmill walking in two sessions separated by 9 days. Trunk acceleration was measured with a 3D accelerometer. Three time scales were used to estimate LDS: over 4 to 10 strides ({\lambda}4-10), over one stride ({\lambda}1) and over one step ({\lambda}0.5). The intrasession repeatability was assessed from three repetitions of either 35 strides or 70 strides taken within the 5min tests. The intersession repeatability compared the two sessions, which totalized 210 strides. The intrasession ICCs (70-strides estimates/35-strides estimates) were 0.52/0.18 for {\lambda}4-10 and 0.84/0.77 for {\lambda}1 and {\lambda}0.5. The intersession ICCs were around 0.60. The SEM results revealed that {\lambda}0.5 measured in medio-lateral direction exhibited the best reliability, sufficient to detect moderate changes at individual level (20%). However, due to the low intersession repeatability, one should average several measurements taken on different days in order to better approximate the true LDS.",q-bio
843,"Neuronal avalanches imply maximum dynamic range in cortical networks at
  criticality","Spontaneous neuronal activity is a ubiquitous feature of cortex. Its spatiotemporal organization reflects past input and modulates future network output. Here we study whether a particular type of spontaneous activity is generated by a network that is optimized for input processing. Neuronal avalanches are a type of spontaneous activity observed in superficial cortical layers in vitro and in vivo with statistical properties expected from a network in a 'critical state'. Theory predicts that the critical state and, therefore, neuronal avalanches are optimal for input processing, but until now, this is untested in experiments. Here, we use cortex slice cultures grown on planar microelectrode arrays to demonstrate that cortical networks which generate neuronal avalanches benefit from maximized dynamic range, i.e. the ability to respond to the greatest range of stimuli. By changing the ratio of excitation and inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus processing as a function of distance from the critical state in agreement with predictions from our simulations. Our findings suggest that in the cortex, (1) balanced excitation and inhibition establishes the critical state, which maximizes the range of inputs that can be processed and (2) spontaneous activity and input processing are unified in the context of critical phenomena.",q-bio
844,Epigenetic Chromatin Silencing: Bistability and Front Propagation,"The role of post-translational modification of histones in eukaryotic gene regulation is well recognized. Epigenetic silencing of genes via heritable chromatin modifications plays a major role in cell fate specification in higher organisms. We formulate a coarse-grained model of chromatin silencing in yeast and study the conditions under which the system becomes bistable, allowing for different epigenetic states. We also study the dynamics of the boundary between the two locally stable states of chromatin: silenced and unsilenced. The model could be of use in guiding the discussion on chromatin silencing in general. In the context of silencing in budding yeast, it helps us understand the phenotype of various mutants, some of which may be non-trivial to see without the help of a mathematical model. One such example is a mutation that reduces the rate of background acetylation of particular histone side-chains that competes with the deacetylation by Sir2p. The resulting negative feedback due to a Sir protein depletion effect gives rise to interesting counter-intuitive consequences. Our mathematical analysis brings forth the different dynamical behaviors possible within the same molecular model and guides the formulation of more refined hypotheses that could be addressed experimentally.",q-bio
845,Growth-rate dependent partitioning of RNA polymerases in bacteria,"Physiological changes which result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Since the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells is dependent on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration which is difficult to quantify directly. Here we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli allow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response following amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.",q-bio
846,Features and dimensions: Motion estimation in fly vision,"We characterize the computation of motion in the fly visual system as a mapping from the high dimensional space of signals in the retinal photodetector array to the probability of generating an action potential in a motion sensitive neuron. Our approach to this problem identifies a low dimensional subspace of signals within which the neuron is most sensitive, and then samples this subspace to visualize the nonlinear structure of the mapping. The results illustrate the computational strategies predicted for a system that makes optimal motion estimates given the physical noise sources in the detector array. More generally, the hypothesis that neurons are sensitive to low dimensional subspaces of their inputs formalizes the intuitive notion of feature selectivity and suggests a strategy for characterizing the neural processing of complex, naturalistic sensory inputs.",q-bio

848,Kinetic Accessibility of Buried DNA Sites in Nucleosomes,"Using a theoretical model for spontaneous partial DNA unwrapping from histones, we study the transient exposure of protein-binding DNA sites within nucleosomes. We focus on the functional dependence of the rates for site exposure and reburial on the site position, which is measurable experimentally and pertinent to gene regulation. We find the dependence to be roughly described by a random walker model. Close inspection reveals a surprising physical effect of flexibility-assisted barrier crossing, which we characterize within a toy model, the ""semiflexible Brownian rotor.""",q-bio
849,"Genetic Transferability of Anomalous Irradiation Alterations of
  Antibiotic Activity","It previously has been discovered that visible light irradiation of crystalline substrates can lead to enhancement of subsequent enzymatic reaction rates as sharply peaked oscillatory functions of irradiation time. The particular activating irradiation times can vary with source of a given enzyme and thus, presumably, its molecular structure. The experiments reported here demonstrate that the potential for this anomalous enzyme reaction rate enhancement can be transferred from one bacterial species to another coincident with transfer of the genetic determinant for the relevant enzyme. In particular, the effect of crystal-irradiated chloramphenicol on growth of bacterial strains in which a transferable R-factor DNA plasmid coding for chloramphenicol resistance was or was not present (S. panama R+, E. coli R+, and E. coli R-) was determined. Chloramphenicol samples irradiated 10, 35 and 60 sec produced increased growth rates (diminished inhibition) for the resistant S. panama and E. coli strains, while having no such effect on growth rate of the sensitive E. coli strain. Consistent with past findings, chloramphenicol samples irradiated 5, 30 and 55 sec produced decreased growth rates (increased inhibition) for all three strains.",q-bio
850,How different are self and nonself?,"Biological and artificial neural networks routinely make reliable distinctions between similar inputs, and the rules for making these distinctions are learned. In some ways, self/nonself discrimination in the immune system is similar, being both reliable and (partly) learned through thymic selection. In contrast to other examples, we show that the distributions of self and nonself peptides are nearly identical but strongly inhomogeneous. Reliable discrimination is possible only because self peptides are a particular finite sample drawn out of this distribution, and the immune system can target the ``spaces'' in between these samples. In conventional learning problems, this would constitute overfitting and lead to disaster. Here, the strong inhomogeneities imply instead that the immune system gains by targeting peptides which are very similar to self, with maximum sensitivity for sequences just one substitution away. This prediction from the structure of the underlying distribution in sequence space agrees, for example, with the observed responses to cancer neoantigens.",q-bio
851,"Why one-size-fits-all vaso-modulatory interventions fail to control
  glioma invasion: in silico insights","There is an ongoing debate on the therapeutic potential of vaso-modulatory interventions against glioma invasion. Prominent vasculature-targeting therapies involve functional tumour-associated blood vessel deterioration and normalisation. The former aims at tumour infarction and nutrient deprivation medi- ated by vascular targeting agents that induce occlusion/collapse of tumour blood vessels. In contrast, the therapeutic intention of normalising the abnormal structure and function of tumour vascular net- works, e.g. via alleviating stress-induced vaso-occlusion, is to improve chemo-, immuno- and radiation therapy efficacy. Although both strategies have shown therapeutic potential, it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion into the surrounding healthy brain tissue. To shed light on this issue, we propose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay between the mi- gration/proliferation dichotomy (Go-or-Grow) of glioma cells and modulations of the functional tumour vasculature. Vaso-modulatory interventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso-occlusion. We discovered the existence of a critical cell proliferation/diffusion ratio that separates glioma invasion re- sponses to vaso-modulatory interventions into two distinct regimes. While for tumours, belonging to one regime, vascular modulations reduce the tumour front speed and increase the infiltration width, for those in the other regime the invasion speed increases and infiltration width decreases. We show how these in silico findings can be used to guide individualised approaches of vaso-modulatory treatment strategies and thereby improve success rates.",q-bio
852,"Designing Experiments to Understand the Variability in Biochemical
  Reaction Networks","Exploiting the information provided by the molecular noise of a biological process has proven to be valuable in extracting knowledge about the underlying kinetic parameters and sources of variability from single cell measurements. However, quantifying this additional information a priori, to decide whether a single cell experiment might be beneficial, is currently only possibly in very simple systems where either the chemical master equation is computationally tractable or a Gaussian approximation is appropriate. Here we show how the information provided by distribution measurements can be approximated from the first four moments of the underlying process. The derived formulas are generally valid for any stochastic kinetic model including models that comprise both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. This allows us to propose an optimal experimental design framework for heterogeneous cell populations which we employ to compare the utility of dual reporter and perturbation experiments for separating extrinsic and intrinsic noise in a simple model of gene expression. Subsequently, we compare the information content of different experiments which have been performed in an engineered light-switch gene expression system in yeast and show that well chosen gene induction patterns may allow one to identify features of the system which remain hidden in unplanned experiments.",q-bio
853,"PUB-MS - a mass-spectrometry-based method to monitor protein-protein
  proximity in vivo","The common techniques to study protein-protein proximity in vivo are not well-adapted to the capabilities and the expertise of a standard proteomics laboratory, typically based on the use of mass spectrometry. With the aim of closing this gap, we have developed PUB-MS (for Proximity Utilizing Biotinylation and Mass Spectrometry), an approach to monitor protein-protein proximity, based on biotinylation of a protein fused to a biotin-acceptor peptide (BAP) by a biotin-ligase, BirA, fused to its interaction partner. The biotinylation status of the BAP can be further detected by either Western analysis or mass spectrometry. The BAP sequence was redesigned for easy monitoring of the biotinylation status by LC-MS/MS. In several experimental models, we demonstrate that the biotinylation in vivo is specifically enhanced when the BAP- and BirA- fused proteins are in proximity to each other. The advantage of mass spectrometry is demonstrated by using BAPs with different sequences in a single experiment (allowing multiplex analysis) and by the use of stable isotopes. Finally, we show that our methodology can be also used to study a specific subfraction of a protein of interest that was in proximity with another protein at a predefined time before the analysis.",q-bio
854,Comparative analysis of some models of mixed-substrate microbial growth,"Mixed-substrate microbial growth is among the most intensely studied systems in molecular microbiology. Several mathematical models have been developed to account for the genetic regulation of such systems, especially those resulting in diauxic growth. In this work, we compare the dynamics of three such models (Narang, Biotech. Bioeng., 59, 116, 1998; Thattai & Shraiman, Biophys. J, 85, 744, 2003; Brandt et al, Water Research, 38, 1004, 2004). We show that these models are dynamically similar - the initial motion of the inducible enzymes in all the models is described by Lotka-Volterra equations for competing species. The dynamic similarity occurs because in all the models, the inducible enzymes possess properties characteristic of competing species: Their synthesis is autocatalytic, and they inhibit each other. Despite this dynamic similarity, the models vary with respect to the range of dynamics captured. The Brandt et al model captures only the diauxic growth pattern, whereas the remaining two models capture both diauxic and non-diauxic growth patterns. The models also differ with respect to the mechanisms that generate the mutual inhibition between the enzymes. In the Narang model, the mutual inhibition occurs because the enzymes for each substrate enhance the dilution of the enzymes for the other substrate. In the Thattai & Shraiman model, the mutual inhibition is entirely due to competition for the phosphoryl groups.",q-bio
855,"Measurement in biological systems from the self-organisation point of
  view","Measurement in biological systems became a subject of concern as a consequence of numerous reports on limited reproducibility of experimental results. To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general features of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their chemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states. Thus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct trajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible sequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained, sometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the organism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And this is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a different framework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the view of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid overoptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely complemented. An increase of specification of experimental procedures is the way for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system may be evolving. And it is hidden in the evolution of experimental protocols.",q-bio
856,"Replica procedure for probabilistic algorithms as a model of gene

We describe gene duplication in the process of biological evolution using introduction of the replica procedure for probabilistic algorithms.

We introduce the family of hidden Markov models where the set of hidden states is a finite additive group with a p-adic metric and build the replica procedure for this family of markovian models.,q-bio

We also describe a geometric model for developing both linear and non-linear potential functions by optimization. Applications of knowledge-based potential functions in protein-decoy discrimination, in protein-protein interactions, and in protein design are then described. Several issues of knowledge-based potential functions are finally discussed.",q-bio
858,"Comparative Analysis of Tandem Repeats from Hundreds of Species Reveals
  Unique Insights into Centromere Evolution","Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation, yet their DNA sequences evolve rapidly. In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres contain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very little is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share common properties between different species across different phyla. We used bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. The assumption that the most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA was true for most species whose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a general property of genomes. Our methods are compatible with all current sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to find tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. High-copy centromere tandem repeats were found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were highly variable in sequence composition and in length. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence conservation beyond ~50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an overall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse species showed similar modes of evolution, including the appearance of higher order repeat structures in which several polymorphic monomers make up a larger repeating unit. While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically determined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at centromeres of both animals and plants. This suggests a functional role for such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes.",q-bio
859,"Multi class intracellular protein targeting predictions in diatoms and
  other algae with complex plastids: ASAFind 2.0","Cells of diatoms and related algae with complex plastids of red algal origin are highly compartmentalized. These plastids are surrounded by four envelope membranes, which also define the periplastidic compartment (PPC), the space between the second and third membranes. The PPC corresponds to the cytosol of the eukaryotic alga that was the ancestor of the complex plastid. Metabolic reactions as well as cell biological processes take place in this compartment; however, its exact function remains elusive. Automated predictions of protein locations proved useful for genome wide explorations of metabolism in the case of plastid proteins, but until now, no automated method for the prediction of PPC proteins was available. Here, we present an updated version of the plastid protein predictor ASAFind, which includes optional prediction of PPC proteins. The new ASAFind version also accepts the output of the most recent versions of SignalP (5.0) and TargetP (2.0) input data. Furthermore, we release a Python script to calculate custom scoring matrices for adjustment of the ASAFind method to other groups of algae, and included the option to run the predictions with custom scoring matrices in a simplified score cut-off mode.",q-bio

861,Frequency Structure of Heart Rate Variability,"Factor structure of heart rate periodogram has been detected with factor analysis. The results showed that there are at least four periodical phenomena of HRV. Two of them have not been discovered and physiologically explained yet. Their frequency ranges are 0.21 to 0.31 1/beat with the peak at 0.26 1/beat and 0.25 to 0.5 1/beat with the peak 0.35 1/beat. Despite of differences of the peak frequencies the frequency rages of the factors are overlapped. Therefore, power of spectral density within any frequency range could not be a measure of a modulating physiological mechanism activity.",q-bio
862,Optimal Translation Along a Circular mRNA,"The ribosome flow model on a ring (RFMR) is a deterministic model for translation of a circularized mRNA. We derive a new spectral representation for the optimal steady-state production rate and the corresponding optimal steady-state ribosomal density in the RFMR. This representation has several important advantages. First, it provides a simple and numerically stable algorithm for determining the optimal values even in very long rings. Second, it enables efficient computation of the sensitivity of the optimal production rate to small changes in the transition rates along the mRNA. Third, it implies that the optimal steady-state production rate is a strictly concave function of the transition rates. Thus maximizing the optimal steady-state production rate with respect to the rates, under an affine constraint on the rates becomes a convex optimization problem that admits a unique solution, which can be determined numerically using highly efficient algorithms. This optimization problem is important, for example, when re-engineering heterologous genes in a host organism. We describe the implications of our results to this and other aspects of translation.",q-bio
863,Ensemble Analysis of Adaptive Compressed Genome Sequencing Strategies,"Acquiring genomes at single-cell resolution has many applications such as in the study of microbiota. However, deep sequencing and assembly of all of millions of cells in a sample is prohibitively costly. A property that can come to rescue is that deep sequencing of every cell should not be necessary to capture all distinct genomes, as the majority of cells are biological replicates. Biologically important samples are often sparse in that sense. In this paper, we propose an adaptive compressed method, also known as distilled sensing, to capture all distinct genomes in a sparse microbial community with reduced sequencing effort. As opposed to group testing in which the number of distinct events is often constant and sparsity is equivalent to rarity of an event, sparsity in our case means scarcity of distinct events in comparison to the data size. Previously, we introduced the problem and proposed a distilled sensing solution based on the breadth first search strategy. We simulated the whole process which constrained our ability to study the behavior of the algorithm for the entire ensemble due to its computational intensity. In this paper, we modify our previous breadth first search strategy and introduce the depth first search strategy. Instead of simulating the entire process, which is intractable for a large number of experiments, we provide a dynamic programming algorithm to analyze the behavior of the method for the entire ensemble. The ensemble analysis algorithm recursively calculates the probability of capturing every distinct genome and also the expected total sequenced nucleotides for a given population profile. Our results suggest that the expected total sequenced nucleotides grows proportional to $\log$ of the number of cells and proportional linearly with the number of distinct genomes.",q-bio
864,On the Stability of Metabolic Cycles,"We investigate the stability properties of two different classes of metabolic cycles using a combination of analytical and computational methods. Using principles from structural kinetic modeling (SKM), we show that the stability of metabolic networks with certain structural regularities can be studied using a combination of analytical and computational techniques. We then apply these techniques to a class of single input, single output metabolic cycles, and find that the cycles are stable under all conditions tested. Next, we extend our analysis to a small autocatalytic cycle, and determine parameter regimes within which the cycle is very likely to be stable. We demonstrate that analytical methods can be used to understand the relationship between kinetic parameters and stability, and that results from these analytical methods can be confirmed with computational experiments. In addition, our results suggest that elevated metabolite concentrations and certain crucial saturation parameters can strongly affect the stability of the entire metabolic cycle. We discuss our results in light of the possibility that evolutionary forces may select for metabolic network topologies with a high intrinsic probability of being stable. Furthermore, our conclusions support the hypothesis that certain types of metabolic cycles may have played a role in the development of primitive metabolism despite the absence of regulatory mechanisms.",q-bio

The AFM tip was used not only for imaging but presumably to remove mechanically large patches of the outer cell wall after appropriate chemical treatment, which typically leaves the bacteria alive. The surface exposed after such a surgery revealed ca. 26 nm thick twisted strands within the cell wall.

  conformation","To understand the mechanism of TATA-box conformational transformations we model structure mobility and find the types of conformational excitations of DNA macromolecule in heteronomous conformation. We have constructed the two-component model for describing DNA conformational transformation with simultaneous transitions in the furanos rings of the monomer link. Internal component describes the change of the base pair position in the double helix. External component describes the displacement of mass center of the monomer link. Nonlinearity of the system is accounted with a form of potential energy describing C3'-C2' and C2'-C3' sugars transitions in monomer link, and interrelation between monomer conformational transition and macromolecule deformation. The comparison of our results with experimental data allows to confirm that the localized conformational excitations may realise in DNA TATA-box. These excitations cause the deformation of the macromolecule fragment.",q-bio
867,"Ascorbic acid enhances the inhibitory effect of aspirin on neuronal
  cyclooxygenase-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 production","In the present study, we show that ascorbic acid dose-dependently inhibited interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-mediated PGE2 synthesis in the human neuronal cell line, SK-N-SH. Furthermore, in combination with aspirin, ascorbic acid augmented the inhibitory effect of aspirin on PGE2 synthesis. However, ascorbic acid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and indomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic acid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Rather, ascorbic acid dose-dependently (0.1-100 microM) produced a significant reduction in IL-1beta-mediated production of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a reliable indicator of free radical formation, suggesting that the effects of ascorbic acid on COX-2-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis may be the result of the maintenance of the neuronal redox status since COX activity is known to be enhanced by oxidative stress. Our results provide in vitro evidence that the neuroprotective effects of ascorbic acid may depend, at least in part, on its ability to reduce neuronal COX-2 activity and PGE2 synthesis, owing to its antioxidant properties. Further, these experiments suggest that a combination of aspirin with ascorbic acid constitutes a novel approach to render COX-2 more sensitive to inhibition by aspirin, allowing an anti-inflammatory therapy with lower doses of aspirin, thereby avoiding the side effects of the usually high dose aspirin treatment.",q-bio

870,"Comparison of SVM and Spectral Embedding in Promoter Biobricks'
  Categorizing and Clustering","Background: In organisms' genomes, promoters are short DNA sequences on the upstream of structural genes, with the function of controlling genes' transcription. Promoters can be roughly divided into two classes: constitutive promoters and inducible promoters. Promoters with clear functional annotations are practical synthetic biology biobricks. Many statistical and machine learning methods have been introduced to predict the functions of candidate promoters. Spectral Eigenmap has been proved to be an effective clustering method to classify biobricks, while support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm, especially when dataset is small. Methods: The two algorithms: spectral embedding and SVM are applied to the same dataset with 375 prokaryotic promoters. For spectral embedding, a Laplacian matrix is built with edit distance, followed by K-Means Clustering. The sequences are represented by numeric vector to serve as dataset for SVM trainning. Results: SVM achieved a high predicting accuracy of 93.07% in 10-fold cross validation for classification of promoters' transcriptional functions. Laplacian eigenmap (spectral embedding) based on editing distance may not be capable for extracting discriminative features for this task.",q-bio
871,"Response kinetics of tethered bacteria to stepwise changes in nutrient
  concentration","We examined the changes in swimming behaviour of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides in response to stepwise changes in a nutrient (propionate), following the prestimulus motion, the initial response and the adaptation to the sustained concentration of the chemical. This was carried out by tethering motile cells by their flagella to glass slides and following the rotational behaviour of their cell bodies in response to the nutrient change. Computerised motion analysis was used to analyse the behaviour. Distributions of run and stop times were obtained from rotation data for tethered cells. Exponential and Weibull fits for these distributions, and variability in individual responses are discussed. In terms of parameters derived from the run and stop time distributions, we compare the responses to stepwise changes in the nutrient concentration and the long-term behaviour of 84 cells under twelve propionate concentration levels from 1 nM to 25 mM. We discuss traditional assumptions for the random walk approximation to bacterial swimming and compare them with the observed R. sphaeroides motile behaviour.",q-bio
872,Growth efficiency as a cellular objective in Eschericia coli,"The identification of cellular objectives is one of the central topics in the research of microbial metabolic networks. In particular, the information about a cellular objective is needed in flux balance analysis which is a commonly used constrained-based metabolic network analysis method for the prediction of cellular phenotypes. The cellular objective may vary depending on the organism and its growth conditions. It is probable that nutritionally scarce conditions are very common in the nature and, in order to survive in those conditions, cells exhibit various highly efficient nutrient processing systems like enzymes. In this study, we explore the efficiency of a metabolic network in transformation of substrates to new biomass, and we introduce a new objective function simulating growth efficiency.   We examined the properties of growth efficiency using a metabolic model for Eschericia coli. We found that the maximal growth efficiency is obtained at a finite nutrient uptake rate. The rate is substrate-dependent and it typically does not exceed 20 mmol/h/gDW. We further examined whether the maximal growth efficiency could serve as a cellular objective function in metabolic network analysis, and found that cellular growth in batch cultivation can be predicted reasonably well under this assumption. The fit to experimental data was found slightly better than with the commonly used objective function of maximal growth rate.   Based on our results, we suggest that the maximal growth efficiency can be considered as a plausible optimization criterion in metabolic modeling for E. coli. In the future, it would be interesting to study growth efficiency as a cellular objective also in other cellular systems and under different cultivation conditions.",q-bio

The second one concerns the existence of a Hopf bifurcation on the delay parameter, and it implies the existence of nonconstant periodic solutions for special delay values. A key idea is the use of the Schwarzian derivative, and its application for the study of Michaelis-Menten nonlinearities. The positive feedback case is also addressed.",q-bio

We review here the recent developments in multiphoton FLIM methods and also present a description of a novel multiphoton FLIM system using a streak camera that was developed in our laboratory. We provide an example of a typical application of the system in which we measure the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor/acceptor pair of fluorescent proteins within a cellular specimen.,q-bio
875,"Rapid, parallel path planning by propagating wavefronts of spiking
  neural activity","Efficient path planning and navigation is critical for animals, robotics, logistics and transportation. We study a model in which spatial navigation problems can rapidly be solved in the brain by parallel mental exploration of alternative routes using propagating waves of neural activity. A wave of spiking activity propagates through a hippocampus-like network, altering the synaptic connectivity. The resulting vector field of synaptic change then guides a simulated animal to the appropriate selected target locations. We demonstrate that the navigation problem can be solved using realistic, local synaptic plasticity rules during a single passage of a wavefront. Our model can find optimal solutions for competing possible targets or learn and navigate in multiple environments. The model provides a hypothesis on the possible computational mechanisms for optimal path planning in the brain, at the same time it is useful for neuromorphic implementations, where the parallelism of information processing proposed here can fully be harnessed in hardware.",q-bio
876,"Predictive modelling of a novel anti-adhesion therapy to combat
  bacterial colonisation of burn wounds","As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule (MAM) 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against in vivo data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the epithelium and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the epithelium and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the epithelium into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.",q-bio
877,"A mathematical model coupling polarity signaling to cell adhesion
  explains diverse cell migration patterns","Cells crawling through tissues migrate inside a complex fibrous environment called the extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides signals regulating motility. Here we investigate one such well-known pathway, involving mutually antagonistic signalling molecules (small GTPases Rac and Rho) that control the protrusion and contraction of the cell edges (lamellipodia). Invasive melanoma cells were observed migrating on surfaces with topography (array of posts), coated with adhesive molecules (fibronectin, FN) by Park et al., 2016. Several distinct qualitative behaviors they observed included persistent polarity, oscillation between the cell front and back, and random dynamics. To gain insight into the link between intracellular and ECM signaling, we compared experimental observations to a sequence of mathematical models encoding distinct hypotheses. The successful model required several critical factors. (1) Competition of lamellipodia for limited pools of GTPases. (2) Protrusion / contraction of lamellipodia influence ECM signaling. (3) ECM-mediated activation of Rho. A model combining these elements explains all three cellular behaviors and correctly predicts the results of experimental perturbations. This study yields new insight into how the dynamic interactions between intracellular signaling and the cell's environment influence cell behavior.",q-bio
878,Contextual Emergence of Mental States from Neurodynamics,"The emergence of mental states from neural states by partitioning the neural phase space is analyzed in terms of symbolic dynamics. Well-defined mental states provide contexts inducing a criterion of structural stability for the neurodynamics that can be implemented by particular partitions. This leads to distinguished subshifts of finite type that are either cyclic or irreducible. Cyclic shifts correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points or limit tori whereas irreducible shifts are obtained from generating partitions of mixing hyperbolic systems. These stability criteria are applied to the discussion of neural correlates of consiousness, to the definition of macroscopic neural states, and to aspects of the symbol grounding problem. In particular, it is shown that compatible mental descriptions, topologically equivalent to the neurodynamical description, emerge if the partition of the neural phase space is generating. If this is not the case, mental descriptions are incompatible or complementary. Consequences of this result for an integration or unification of cognitive science or psychology, respectively, will be indicated.",q-bio
879,"The motility of normal and cancer cells in response to the combined
  influence of substrate rigidity and anisotropic microstructure","Cell adhesion and migration are strongly influenced by extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture and rigidity, but little is known about the concomitant influence of such environmental signals to cell responses, especially when considering cells of similar origin and morphology, but exhibiting a normal or cancerous phenotype. Using micropatterned polydimethylsiloxane substrates (PDMS) with tuneable stiffness (500kPa, 750kPa, 2000kPa) and topography (lines, pillars or unpatterned), we systematically analyse the differential response of normal (3T3) and cancer (SaI/N) fibroblastic cells. Our results demonstrate that both cells exhibit differential morphology and motility responses to changes in substrate rigidiy and microtopography. 3T3 polarization and spreading are influenced by substrate microtopography and rigidity. The cells exhibit a persistent type of migration, which depends on the substrate anisotropy. In contrast, the dynamic of SaI/N spreading is strongly modified by the substrate topography but not by substrate rigidity. SaI/N morphology and migration seem to escape from extracellular cues: the cells exhibit uncorrelated migration trajectories and a large dispersion of their migration speed, which increases with substrate rigidity.",q-bio
880,"Protein Folding as a Quantum Transition Between Conformational States:
  Basic Formulas and Applications","The protein folding is regarded as a quantum transition between torsion states on polypeptide chain. The deduction of the folding rate formula in our previous studies is reviewed. The rate formula is generalized to the case of frequency variation in folding. Then the following problems about the application of the rate theory are discussed: 1) The unified theory on the two-state and multi-state protein folding is given based on the concept of quantum transition. 2) The relationship of folding and unfolding rates vs denaturant concentration is studied. 3) The temperature dependence of folding rate is deduced and the non-Arrhenius behaviors of temperature dependence are interpreted in a natural way. 4) The inertial moment dependence of folding rate is calculated based on the model of dynamical contact order and consistent results are obtained by comparison with one-hundred-protein experimental dataset. 5) The exergonic and endergonic foldings are distinguished through the comparison between theoretical and experimental rates for each protein. The ultrafast folding problem is viewed from the point of quantum folding theory and a new folding speed limit is deduced from quantum uncertainty relation. And finally, 6) since only the torsion-accessible states are manageable in the present formulation of quantum transition how the set of torsion-accessible states can be expanded by using statistical energy landscape approach is discussed. All above discussions support the view that the protein folding is essentially a quantum transition between conformational states.",q-bio
881,Biological network comparison via Ipsen-Mikhailov distance,"Highlighting similarities and differences between networks is an informative task in investigating many biological processes. Typical examples are detecting differences between an inferred network and the corresponding gold standard, or evaluating changes in a dynamic network along time. Although fruitful insights can be drawn by qualitative or feature-based methods, a distance must be used whenever a quantitative assessment is required. Here we introduce the Ipsen-Mikhailov metric for biological network comparison, based on the difference of the distributions of the Laplacian eigenvalues of the compared graphs. Being a spectral measure, its focus is on the general structure of the net so it can overcome the issues affecting local metrics such as the edit distances. Relation with the classical Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is discussed, showing the finer discriminant resolution achieved by the Ipsen-Mikhailov metric. We conclude with three examples of application in functional genomic tasks, including stability of network reconstruction as robustness to data subsampling, variability in dynamical networks and differences in networks associated to a classification task.",q-bio
882,"Energy Balance in Cell Phone Radiofrequency Radiation Exposed Mice and
  Rats","The National Toxicology Program exposed mice and rats to cell phone radiofrequency radiation. They observer cancers in male rats but not in male mice and different increases in body temperature between mice and rats using identical frequency and intensity exposures. Using the Faraday's Law model, thermoregulation considerations and an energy balance equation, we estimate that the increase in temperature of neural circuits of mice exposed to radiofrequency radiation is only 0.28 that of rats. This decrease in neural circuit temperatures is consistent with the absence of cancer in mice. This calculation also qualitatively explains the different increases in body temperature in mice and rats under different radiofrequency intensities and frequencies.",q-bio
883,Protein structure prediction by an iterative search method,"We demonstrate a new algorithm for finding protein conformations that minimize a non-bonded energy function. The new algorithm, called the difference map, seeks to find an atomic configuration that is simultaneously in two constraint spaces. The first constraint space is the space of atomic configurations that have a valid peptide geometry, while the second is the space of configurations that have a non-bonded energy below a given target. These two constraint spaces are used to define a deterministic dynamical system, whose fixed points produce atomic configurations in the intersection of the two constraint spaces. The rate at which the difference map produces low energy protein conformations is compared with that of a contemporary search algorithm, parallel tempering. The results indicate the difference map finds low energy protein conformations at a significantly higher rate then parallel tempering.",q-bio
884,"Latent periodicity of serine-threonine and tyrosine protein kinases and
  another protein families","We identified latent periodicity in catalytic domains of approximately 85% of serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases. Similar results were obtained for other 22 protein domains. We also designed the method of noise decomposition, which is aimed to distinguish between different periodicity types of the same period length. The method is to be used in conjunction with the cyclic profile alignment, and this combination is able to reveal structure-related or function-related patterns of latent periodicity. Possible origins of the periodic structure of protein kinase active sites are discussed. Summarizing, we presume that latent periodicity is the common property of many catalytic protein domains.",q-bio

Here we present a Bayesian- based derivation of multi-view deconvolution that drastically improves the convergence time and provide a fast implementation utilizing graphics hardware.",q-bio
887,Wringing out DNA,"The chiral nature of DNA plays a crucial role in cellular processes. Here we use magnetic tweezers to explore one of the signatures of this chirality, the coupling between stretch and twist deformations. We show that the extension of a stretched DNA molecule increases linearly by 0.42 nm per excess turn applied to the double helix. This result contradicts the intuition that DNA should lengthen as it is unwound and get shorter with overwinding. We then present numerical results of energy minimizations of torsionally restrained DNA that display a behaviour similar to the experimental data and shed light on the molecular details of this surprising effect.",q-bio
888,"Presence of pKa Perturbations Among Homeodomain Residues Facilitates DNA
  Binding",Homeodomain containing proteins are a broad class of DNA binding proteins that are believed to primarily function as transcription factors. Electrostatics interactions have been demonstrated to be critical for the binding of the homeodomain to DNA. An examination of the electrostatic state of homeodomain residues involved in DNA phosphate binding has demonstrated the conserved presence of upward shifted pKa values among the basic residue of lysine and arginine. It is believed that these pKa perturbations work to facilitate binding to DNA since they ensure that the basic residues always retain a positive charge.,q-bio

  data of HeLa cells - our first experience","The TNF initiated processes are simulated using our integrative computational model with new quantitative proteomics data obtained on HeLa cell line. In spite of fact, that the model development is based on limited experimental information, with missing data estimated by simulations and parametrization using indirect experiments on different cell lines, the actual model with HeLa experimental data provides pleasant agreement between the computationally predicted behavior and experiments. Since no significant departures from experimentally determined functionality of HeLa cells has been observed, this can be taken as encouraging sign, that substantial features of the cell line behavior are reproduced correctly and indicate new possibilities for cell-line specific computational experiments.",q-bio
890,"HetFHMM: A novel approach to infer tumor heterogeneity using factorial
  Hidden Markov model","Cancer arises from successive rounds of mutations which generate tumor cells with different genomic variation i.e. clones. For drug responsiveness and therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.",q-bio
891,"The role of food chain balance and common nutritional environment in
  interspecific allometric scaling of unicellular organisms","One of the major characteristics of living organisms is metabolic rate - amount of energy produced per unit time. When the size of organisms increases, the metabolic rate increases slower than organisms' mass. This effect is called allometric scaling. It has important implications for the individual and population organismal development. Here, we study the causes of this phenomenon considering metabolic properties of unicellular organisms (Amoeba Proteus, fission yeast S. pombe, E. coli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus). We found that the metabolic properties of unicellular organisms are defined by two primary factors. One is the need to acquire nutrients through the surface in a common nutritional environment, which forms the base part of 2/3 of an allometric exponent. The other factor is a regular increase of nutrient influx per unit surface, when organisms' mass increases. This is a manifestation of metabolic advantage, which bigger organisms need to have in order to support their metabolic requirements. On the other hand, this advantage cannot be too strong, which could lead to destruction of species, organisms feed on or compete for nutrients within the food chain. Accounting for this regular increase of nutrient influx, we obtained allometric exponents and their range close to experimental values. This supports an argument that the metabolic properties of living organisms, and interspecific allometric scaling in particular, indeed, are defined by nutrient acquisition through the surface and a regular increase of nutrient influx per unit surface, in a way that preserves a dynamic balance between populations within the food chain.",q-bio
892,Transport Facilitated by Rapid Binding to Elastic Tethers,"Diffusion in cell biology is important and complicated. Diffusing particles must contend with a complex environment as they make their way through the cell. We analyze a particular type of complexity that arises when diffusing particles reversibly bind to elastically tethered binding partners. Using asymptotic analysis, we derive effective equations for the transport of both single and multiple particles in the presence of such elastic tethers. We show that for the case of linear elasticity and simple binding kinetics, the elastic tethers have a weak hindering effect on particle motion when only one particle is present, while, remarkably, strongly enhancing particle motion when multiple particles are present. We give a physical interpretation of this result that suggests a similar effect may be present in other biological settings.",q-bio
893,"Fast reconstruction of compact context-specific metabolic networks via
  integration of microarray data","Recently we proposed an algorithm for the fast reconstruction of compact context-specific metabolic networks (FASTCORE) that allowed dropping the reconstruction time to the time order of seconds (Vlassis et al.,2014). This extremely low computational demand opens new possibilities for improving the quality of the models. Several rounds of model reconstruction, testing of the model's predictions against real experimental data, curation steps of the input model and the set of core reactions as well as cross-validations assays are required to reconstruct high-quality models. These semi-automated model curations steps are in such extend not possible with competing algorithms due to their high computational demands. To adapt FASTCORE for the integration of microarray data, we therefore propose a new workflow: FASTCORMICS. FASTCORMICS requires as input microarray data and a Genome-scale reconstruction. FASTCORMICS is devoid of heuristic parameter settings and has a low computational demand with overall building times in the order of a few minutes. FASTCORMICS preprocesses the microarrays data with the discretization tool Barcode (Zillox et al, 2007). Barcode uses prior knowledge on the intensity distribution of each probe set for a given microarray platform to segregate between expressed genes and non-expressed genes. This preprocessing step allows circumventing the need of setting a heuristic expression threshold, which is critical for the output models as in response to this threshold alternative pathways or subsystems might be included or excluded, thereby heavily changing the functionalities of the model.   In general, FASTCORMICS outperforms competing algorithms and allows obtaining high-quality, robust models in a high-throughput manner. This will allow the use of metabolic modelling as routine process for the analysis of microarray data e.g. in the field of personalized medicine.",q-bio
894,"Emergent Transport Properties of Molecular Motor Ensemble Affected by
  Single Motor Mutations","Intracellular transport is an essential function in eucaryotic cells, facilitated by motor proteins - proteins converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. It is known that motor proteins work in teams enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long distances. Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor domain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a recent study of phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating lowered single motor stalling forces. In this article we report the effects of mutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It is shown that mutants gain a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in expected run-length when load on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant's stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force. A separate contribution of this article is the development of a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the transition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables exact computation of average velocity and run-length. It can also be used to introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation and to deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors. Our method is easily implementable and we provide a software package for general use.",q-bio
895,"Base pair interactions and hybridization isotherms of matched and
  mismatched oligonucleotide probes on microarrays","The lack of specificity in microarray experiments due to non-specific hybridization raises a serious problem for the analysis of microarray data because the residual chemical background intensity is not related to the expression degree of the gene of interest. We analyzed the concentration dependence of the signal intensity of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes in terms using a microscopic binding model using a combination of mean hybridization isotherms and single base related affinity terms. The signal intensities of the PM and MM probes and their difference are assessed with regard to their sensitivity, specificity and resolution for gene expression measures. The presented theory implies the refinement of existing algorithms of probe level analysis to correct microarray data for non-specific background intensities.",q-bio

  in a unimodal distribution of resources","A microscopic agent dynamical model for diploid age-structured populations is used to study evolution of polymorphism and sympatric speciation. The underlying ecology is represented by a unimodal distribution of resources of some width. Competition among individuals is also described by a similar distribution, and its strength is maximum for individuals with the same phenotype and decreases with distance in phenotype space as a gaussian, with some width. These two widths define the model's phase space, in which we identify the regions where an autonomous emergence of stable polymorphism or speciation is more likely.",q-bio
897,"Impact of intrinsic biophysical diversity on the activity of spiking
  neurons","We study the effect of intrinsic heterogeneity on the activity of a population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. By rescaling the dynamical equation, we derive mathematical relations between multiple neuronal parameters and a fluctuating input noise. To this end, common input to heterogeneous neurons is conceived as an identical noise with neuron-specific mean and variance. As a consequence, the neuronal output rates can differ considerably, and their relative spike timing becomes desynchronized. This theory can quantitatively explain some recent experimental findings.",q-bio

899,"Does Face Image Statistics Predict a Preferred Spatial Frequency for
  Human Face Processing?","Psychophysical experiments suggested a relative importance of a narrow band of spatial frequencies for recognition of face identity in humans. There exists, however, no conclusive evidence of why it is that such frequencies are preferred. To address this question, I examined the amplitude spectra of a large number of face images, and observed that face spectra generally fall off steeper with spatial frequency compared to ordinary natural images. When external face features (like hair) are suppressed, then whitening of the corresponding mean amplitude spectra revealed higher response amplitudes at those spatial frequencies which are deemed important for processing face identity. The results presented here therefore provide support for that face processing characteristics match corresponding stimulus properties.",q-bio
900,A p53 Oscillator Model of DNA Break Repair Control,"The transcription factor p53 is an important regulator of cell fate. Mutations in p53 gene are associated with many cancers. In response to signals such as DNA damage, p53 controls the transcription of a series of genes that cause cell cycle arrest during which DNA damage is repaired, or triggers programmed cell death that eliminates possibly cancerous cells wherein DNA damage might have remained unrepaired. Previous experiments showed oscillations in p53 level in response to DNA damage, but the mechanism of oscillation remained unclear. Here we examine a model where the concentrations of p53 isoforms are regulated by Mdm22, Arf, Siah, and beta-catenin. The extent of DNA damage is signalled through the switch-like activity of a DNA damage sensor, the DNA-dependent protein kinase Atm. This switch is responsible for initiating and terminating oscillations in p53 concentration. The strength of the DNA damage signal modulates the number of oscillatory waves of p53 and Mdm22 but not the frequency or amplitude of oscillations{a result that recapitulates experimental findings. A critical fnding was that the phosphorylated form of Nbs11, a member of the DNA break repair complex Mre11-Rad50-Nbs11 (MRN), must augment the activity of Atm kinase. While there is in vitro support for this assumption, this activity appears essential for p53 dynamics. The model provides several predictions concerning, among others, degradation of the phosphorylated form of p53, the rate of DNA repair as a function of DNA damage, the sensitivity of p53 oscillation to transcription rates of SIAH, beta-CATENIN and ARF, and the hysteretic behavior of active Atm kinase levels with respect to the DNA damage signal",q-bio
901,Phenotypic variability in Italian rice germplasm,"Plant breeding is one of the key strategies for further enhancement of crop yields; however, effective breeding strategies require phenotypic characterisation of the available germplasm. This study sought to characterise the phenotypic expression of fourteen crop traits related to phenology, plant architecture, and yield in a panel of 40 cultivars selected to represent the phenotypic variability present in Italian rice germplasm during a two-season field experiment. The observed range of phenotypic variation was high for many traits (coefficients of variation ranging from 5.9\% to 45.4\%) including yield (mean: 6.47 t ha\textsuperscript{-1}; CV: 15.4\%; min: 2.19 t ha\textsuperscript{-1}; max: 8.95 t ha\textsuperscript{-1}), and multiple strong associations emerged in all the analysed traits. Cluster analysis extracted three groups of genotypes characterised by alternative yield strategies, i.e. ""high-tillering"", ""early maturing"", and ""increased source-sink"". Our findings highlight that rice yield decrease when one strategy is overemphasised. In contrast, the highest-yielding genotypes have a balanced ratio between sink and source organs, along with a proportional duration of vegetative and reproductive phases. This study depicts the phenotypic variability in Italian rice cultivars and proposes a novel classification based on yield-related traits which could be of use in multiple rice breeding applications.",q-bio
902,"Neuronal Shot Noise and Brownian $1/f^2$ Behavior in the Local Field
  Potential","We demonstrate that human electrophysiological recordings of the local field potential (LFP) from intracranial electrodes, acquired from a variety of cerebral regions, show a ubiquitous $1/f^2$ scaling within the power spectrum. We develop a quantitative model that treats the generation of these fields in an analogous way to that of electronic shot noise, and use this model to specifically address the cause of this $1/f^2$ Brownian noise. The model gives way to two analytically tractable solutions, both displaying Brownian noise: 1) uncorrelated cells that display sharp initial activity, whose extracellular fields slowly decay and 2) rapidly firing, temporally correlated cells that generate UP-DOWN states.",q-bio
903,"Stochastic phenotype transition of a single cell in an intermediate
  region of gene-state switching","Multiple phenotypic states often arise in a single cell with different gene-expression states that undergo transcription regulation with positive feedback. Recent experiments have shown that at least in E. coli, the gene state switching can be neither extremely slow nor exceedingly rapid as many previous theoretical treatments assumed. Rather it is in the intermediate region which is difficult to handle mathematically.Under this condition, from a full chemical-master-equation description we derive a model in which the protein copy-number, for a given gene state, follow a deterministic mean-field description while the protein synthesis rates fluctuate due to stochastic gene-state switching. The simplified kinetics yields a nonequilibrium landscape function, which, similar to the energy function for equilibrium fluctuation, provides the leading orders of fluctuations around each phenotypic state, as well as the transition rates between the two phenotypic states. This rate formula is analogous to Kramers theory for chemical reactions. The resulting behaviors are significantly different from the two limiting cases studied previously.",q-bio

  search movements","Correlated random walks (CRW) have been used for a long time as a null model for animal's random search movement in two dimensions (2D). An increasing number of studies focus on animals' movement in three dimensions (3D), but the key properties of CRW, such as the way the mean squared displacement is related to the path length, are well known only in 1D and 2D. In this paper I derive such properties for 3D CRW, in a consistent way with the expression of these properties in 2D. This should allow 3D CRW to act as a null model when analyzing actual 3D movements similarly to what is done in 2D",q-bio
905,"Living beings as informed systems: towards a physical theory of
  information","I propose here a new concept of information based on two relevant aspects of its expression. The first related to the undeniable fact that the expression of information modifies the physical state of its receiver. The second to the arbitrariness of such physical changes. In fact, these changes are not deducible from physical laws but from a code established arbitrarily. Thus, physical information is proposed here as the capacity of producing arbitrary changes. Once defined physical information from this physical point of view, I deduce some basic properties of informed systems. These properties (renewal, self-reproducing, evolution, diversification) are immediately recognized as the attributes most characteristic of living beings, the only natural informed systems we know. I also propose here a double evaluation of information. The former is an absolute measure of the physical effects of its expression based on Einstein's probability. The second is a functional measure based on the probability that an informed systems attain a given objective as consequence of the expression of its information.",q-bio
906,"Coupling biochemistry and mechanics in cell adhesion: a model for
  inhomogeneous stress fiber contraction","Biochemistry and mechanics are closely coupled in cell adhesion. At sites of cell-matrix adhesion, mechanical force triggers signaling through the Rho-pathway, which leads to structural reinforcement and increased contractility in the actin cytoskeleton. The resulting force acts back to the sites of adhesion, resulting in a positive feedback loop for mature adhesion. Here we model this biochemical-mechanical feedback loop for the special case when the actin cytoskeleton is organized in stress fibers, which are contractile bundles of actin filaments. Activation of myosin II molecular motors through the Rho-pathway is described by a system of reaction-diffusion equations, which are coupled into a viscoelastic model for a contractile actin bundle. We find strong spatial gradients in the activation of contractility and in the corresponding deformation pattern of the stress fiber, in good agreement with experimental findings.",q-bio
907,"Application of Fractional Derivatives in Characterization of ECG graphs
  of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy Patients","There are many functions which are continuous everywhere but non-differentiable at some or all points such functions are termed as unreachable functions. Graphs representing such unreachable functions are called unreachable graphs. For example, ECG is such an unreachable graph. Classical calculus fails in their characterization as derivatives do not exist at the unreachable points. Such unreachable functions can be characterized by fractional calculus as fractional derivatives exist at those unreachable points where classical derivatives do not exist. Definition of fractional derivatives has been proposed by several mathematicians like Grunwald-Letinikov, Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, and Jumarie to develop the theory of fractional calculus. In this paper, we have used Jumarie type fractional derivative and consequently the phase transition (P.T.) which is the difference between left fractional derivative and right fractional derivatives to characterize those points. A comparative study has been done between normal ECG sample and problematic ECG sample (Right Ventricular Hypertrophy) by the help of the above mentioned mathematical tool.",q-bio

Such mechanism is sensitive to the structure of nucleotide hydrogen bonds, consequently only one nucleotide sort is captured by DNA-polimerase in each event.The algorithm of this multistep selection mechanism is also analysed from the point of its optimality.

909,"Dynamics of cardiac re-entry in micro-CT and serial histological
  sections based models of mammalian hearts","Cardiac re-entry regime of self-organised abnormal synchronisation underlie dangerous arrhythmias and fatal fibrillation. Recent advances in the theory of dissipative vortices, experimental studies, and anatomically realistic computer simulations, elucidated the role of cardiac re-entry interaction with fine anatomical features in the heart, and anatomy induced drift. The fact that anatomy and structural anisotropy of the heart is consistent within a species suggested its possible functional effect on spontaneous drift of cardiac re-entry. A comparative study of the anatomy induced drift could be used in order to predict evolution of atrial arrhythmia, and improve low-voltage defibrillation protocols and ablation strategies. Here, in micro-CT based model of rat pulmonary vein wall, and in sheep atria models based on high resolution serial histological sections, we demonstrate effects of heart geometry and anisotropy on cardiac re-entry anatomy induced drift, its pinning to fluctuations of thickness in the layer. The data sets of sheep atria and rat pulmonary vein wall are incorporated into the BeatBox High Performance Computing simulation environment. Re-entry is initiated at prescribed locations in the spatially homogeneous mono-domain models of cardiac tissue. Excitation is described by FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics. In the in-silico models, isotropic and anisotropic conduction show specific anatomy effects and the interplay between anatomy and anisotropy of the heart. The main objectives are to demonstrate the functional role of the species hearts geometry and anisotropy on cardiac re-entry anatomy induced drift. In case of the rat pulmonary vein wall with ~90 degree transmural fibre rotation, it is shown that the joint effect of the PV wall geometry and anisotropy turns a plane excitation wave into a re-entry pinned to a small fluctuation of thickness in the wall.",q-bio
910,An Exploration of Physiological Responses to the Native American Flute,"This pilot study explored physiological responses to playing and listening to the Native American flute. Autonomic, electroencephalographic (EEG), and heart rate variability (HRV) metrics were recorded while participants (N = 15) played flutes and listened to several styles of music. Flute playing was accompanied by an 84% increase in HRV (p < .001). EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity increased while playing flutes (p = .007) and alpha (8-12 Hz) increased while playing lower-pitched flutes (p = .009). Increase in alpha from baseline to the flute playing conditions strongly correlated with experience playing Native American flutes (r = +.700). Wide-band beta (12-25 Hz) decreased from the silence conditions when listening to solo Native American flute music (p = .013). The findings of increased HRV, increasing slow-wave rhythms, and decreased beta support the hypothesis that Native American flutes, particularly those with lower pitches, may have a role in music therapy contexts. We conclude that the Native American flute may merit a more prominent role in music therapy and that a study of the effects of flute playing on clinical conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, anxiety, and major depressive disorder, is warranted.",q-bio
911,"Systematic Review of Methods and Prognostic Value of Mitotic Activity.
  Part 1: Feline Tumors","Increased proliferation is a key driver of tumorigenesis, and quantification of mitotic activity is a standard task for prognostication. The goal of this systematic review is scholarly analysis of all available references on mitotic activity in feline tumors, and to provide an overview of the measuring methods and prognostic value. A systematic literature search in PubMed and Scopus and a manual search in Google Scholar was conducted. All articles on feline tumors that correlated mitotic activity with patient outcome were identified. Data analysis revealed that of the eligible 42 articles, the mitotic count (MC, mitotic figures per tumor area) was evaluated in 39 instances and the mitotic index (MI, mitotic figures per tumor cells) in three instances. The risk of bias was considered high for most studies (26/42, 62%) based on small study populations, insufficient details of the MC/MI methods, and lack of statistical measures for diagnostic accuracy or effect on outcome. The MC/MI methods varied markedly between studies. A significant association of the MC with survival was determined in 21/29 (72%) studies, while one study found an inverse effect. There were three tumor types with at least four studies and a prognostic association was found in 5/6 studies on mast cell tumors, 5/5 on mammary tumors and 3/4 on soft tissue sarcomas. The MI was shown to correlate with survival by two research groups, however a comparison to the MC was not conducted. An updated systematic review will be needed with of new literature for different tumor types.",q-bio
912,Revealing missing parts of the interactome,"Protein interaction networks (PINs) are often used to ""learn"" new biological function from their topology. Since current PINs are noisy, their computational de-noising via link prediction (LP) could improve the learning accuracy. LP uses the existing PIN topology to predict missing and spurious links. Many of existing LP methods rely on shared immediate neighborhoods of the nodes to be linked. As such, they have limitations. Thus, in order to comprehensively study what are the topological properties of nodes in PINs that dictate whether the nodes should be linked, we had to introduce novel sensitive LP measures that overcome the limitations of the existing methods.   We systematically evaluate the new and existing LP measures by introducing ""synthetic"" noise to PINs and measuring how well the different measures reconstruct the original PINs. Our main findings are: 1) LP measures that favor nodes which are both ""topologically similar"" and have large shared extended neighborhoods are superior; 2) using more network topology often though not always improves LP accuracy; and 3) our new LP measures are superior to the existing measures. After evaluating the different methods, we use them to de-noise PINs. Importantly, we manage to improve biological correctness of the PINs by de-noising them, with respect to ""enrichment"" of the predicted interactions in Gene Ontology terms. Furthermore, we validate a statistically significant portion of the predicted interactions in independent, external PIN data sources.   Software executables are freely available upon request.",q-bio
913,"Incompressible limit of a continuum model of tissue growth with
  segregation for two cell populations","This paper proposes a model for the growth two interacting populations of cells that do not mix. The dynamics is driven by pressure and cohesion forces on the one hand and proliferation on the other hand. Following earlier works on the single population case, we show that the model approximates a free boundary Hele Shaw type model that we characterise using both analytical and numerical arguments.",q-bio
914,"Phylogenetic mixtures on a single tree can mimic a tree of another
  topology","Phylogenetic mixtures model the inhomogeneous molecular evolution commonly observed in data. The performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods where the underlying data is generated by a mixture model has stimulated considerable recent debate. Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture model data on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a tree of a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomings of particular tree reconstruction methods. In so doing, the underlying assumption was that mixture model data on one topology can be distinguished from data evolved on an unmixed tree of another topology given enough data and the ``correct'' method. Here we show that this assumption can be false. For biologists our results imply that, for example, the combined data from two genes whose phylogenetic trees differ only in terms of branch lengths can perfectly fit a tree of a different topology.",q-bio
915,Dynamic DNA Processing: A Microcode Model of Cell Differentiation,"A general theoretical framework is put forth to organize and understand various observed phenomena and mathematical relationships in the field of molecular biology. By modeling each cell in eukaryotic organisms as a processor having a unique set of allowed states, represented by a specific DNA sequence, we demonstrate a method by which gene expression can be regulated. As the theory is developed, we suggest reasons for the complementary, quaternary (4-base) coding scheme used in most eukaryotes. A role for transposable elements is suggested, as is a role for the abundance of noncoding DNA, along with a clearly-defined method by which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) may alter gene expression. The effect of various errors is considered. Finally, a mechanism for inter-processor communication is proposed to explain cell-cell recognition processes, which leads to an elucidation of a possible pathway by which nonmutagenic carcinogenic agents may act.",q-bio
916,"Maximum-frequency gene tree: a simplified genome-scale approach to
  overcoming incongruence in molecular phylogenies","Genomes and genes diversify during evolution; however, it is unclear to what extent genes still retain the relationship among species. Model species for molecular phylogenetic studies include yeasts and viruses whose genomes were sequenced as well as plants that have the fossil-supported true phylogenetic trees available. In this study, we generated single gene trees of seven yeast species as well as single gene trees of nine baculovirus species using all the orthologous genes among the species compared. Homologous genes among seven known plants were used for validation of the fi nding. Four algorithms: maximum parsimony, minimum evolution, maximum likelihood, and neighbor-joining, were used. Trees were reconstructed before and after weighting the DNA and protein sequence lengths among genes. Rarely a gene can always generate the ""true tree"" by all the four algorithms. However, the most frequent gene tree, termed ""maximum gene-support tree"" (MGS tree, or WMGS tree for the weighted one), in yeasts, baculoviruses, or plants was consistently found to be the ""true tree"" among the species. The results provide insights into the overall degree of divergence of orthologous genes of the genomes analyzed and suggest the following: 1) The true tree relationship among the species studied is still maintained by the largest group of orthologous genes; 2) There are usually more orthologous genes with higher similarities between genetically closer species than between genetically more distant ones; and 3) The maximum gene-support tree refl ects the phylogenetic relationship among species in comparison.

917,DNA: From rigid base-pairs to semiflexible polymers,"The sequence-dependent elasticity of double-helical DNA on a nm length scale can be captured by the rigid base-pair model, whose strains are the relative position and orientation of adjacent base-pairs. Corresponding elastic potentials have been obtained from all-atom MD simulation and from high-resolution structural data. On the scale of a hundred nm, DNA is successfully described by a continuous worm-like chain model with homogeneous elastic properties characterized by a set of four elastic constants, which have been directly measured in single-molecule experiments. We present here a theory that links these experiments on different scales, by systematically coarse-graining the rigid base-pair model for random sequence DNA to an effective worm-like chain description. The average helical geometry of the molecule is exactly taken into account in our approach. We find that the available microscopic parameters sets predict qualitatively similar mesoscopic parameters. The thermal bending and twisting persistence lengths computed from MD data are 42 and 48 nm, respectively. The static persistence lengths are generally much higher, in agreement with cyclization experiments. All microscopic parameter sets predict negative twist-stretch coupling. The variability and anisotropy of bending stiffness in short random chains lead to non-Gaussian bend angle distributions, but become unimportant after two helical turns.",q-bio
918,Adaptive Drift-Diffusion Process to Learn Time Intervals,"Animals learn the timing between consecutive events very easily. Their precision is usually proportional to the interval to time (Weber's law for timing). Most current timing models either require a central clock and unbounded accumulator or whole pre-defined populations of delay lines, decaying traces or oscillators to represent elapsing time. Current adaptive recurrent neural networks fail at learning to predict the timing of future events (the 'when') in a realistic manner. In this paper, we present a new model of interval timing, based on simple temporal integrators, derived from drift-diffusion models. We develop a simple geometric rule to learn 'when' instead of 'what'. We provide an analytical proof that the model can learn inter-event intervals in a number of trials independent of the interval size and that the temporal precision of the system is proportional to the timed interval. This new model uses no clock, no gradient, no unbounded accumulators, no delay lines, and has internal noise allowing generations of individual trials. Three interesting predictions are made.",q-bio
919,Dynamics of heterodimeric kinesins and cooperation of kinesins,"Using the model for the processive movement of a dimeric kinesin we proposed before, we study the dynamics of a number of mutant homodimeric and heterodimeric kinesins that were constructed by Kaseda et al. (Kaseda, K., Higuchi, H. and Hirose, K. PNAS 99, 16058 (2002)). The theoretical results of ATPase rate per head, moving velocity, and stall force of the motors show good agreement with the experimental results by Kaseda et al.: The puzzling dynamic behaviors of heterodimeric kinesin that consists of two distinct heads compared with its parent homodimers can be easily explained by using independent ATPase rates of the two heads in our model. We also study the collective kinetic behaviors of kinesins in MT-gliding motility. The results explains well that the average MT-gliding velocity is independent of the number of bound motors and is equal to the moving velocity of a single kinesin relative to MT.",q-bio

921,Variation in Microbial Growth under Hypergravity,We report bacterial growth under hypergravitational stress. Cultures of E. coli and B. subtilis were subjected to the gravitational stress (38g) and their growth curves were measured using UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Experiments were also carried out to investigate nutrient consumption under hypergravitational conditions. Our results show considerable difference between samples subjected to hypergravity and normal conditions. This study has importance to understand bacterial response to external stress factors like gravity and changes in bacterial system in order to adapt with stress conditions for its survival.,q-bio
922,Delay Line as a Chemical Reaction Network,"Chemistry as an unconventional computing medium presently lacks a systematic approach to gather, store, and sort data over time. To build more complicated systems in chemistries, the ability to look at data in the past would be a valuable tool to perform complex calculations. In this paper we present the first implementation of a chemical delay line providing information storage in a chemistry that can reliably capture information over an extended period of time. The delay line is capable of parallel operations in a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) fashion.   Using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, we describe the chemical delay line implementation featuring an enzyme acting as a means to reduce copy errors. We also discuss how information is randomly accessible from any element on the delay line. Our work shows how the chemical delay line retains and provides a value from a previous cycle. The system's modularity allows for integration with existing chemical systems. We exemplify the delay line capabilities by integration with a threshold asymmetric signal perceptron to demonstrate how it learns all 14 linearly separable binary functions over a size two sliding window. The delay line has applications in biomedical diagnosis and treatment, such as smart drug delivery.",q-bio
923,"Mathematical control theory, the immune system, and cancer","Simple ideas, endowed from the mathematical theory of control, are used in order to analyze in general grounds the human immune system. The general principles are minimization of the pathogen load and economy of resources. They should constrain the parameters describing the immune system. In the simplest linear model, for example, where the response is proportional to the load, the annihilation rate of pathogens in any tissue should be greater than the pathogen's average rate of growth. When nonlinearities are added, a reference value for the number of pathogens is set, and a stability condition emerges, which relates strength of regular threats, barrier height and annihilation rate. The stability condition allows a qualitative comparison between tissues. On the other hand, in cancer immunity, the linear model leads to an expression for the lifetime risk, which accounts for both the effects of carcinogens (endogenous or external) and the immune response.",q-bio
924,"Local transition gradients determine the global attributes of protein
  energy landscapes","The dynamical characterization of proteins is crucial to understand protein function. From a microscopic point of view, protein dynamics is governed by the local atomic interactions that, in turn, trigger the functional conformational changes. Unfortunately, the relationship between local atomic fluctuations and global protein rearrangements is still elusive. Here, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with complex network analysis show that fast peptide relaxations effectively build the backbone of the global free-energy landscape, providing a connection between local and global atomic rearrangements. A minimum-spanning-tree representation, built on the base of transition gradients networks, results in a high resolution mapping of the system dynamics and thermodynamics without requiring any a priori knowledge of the relevant degrees of freedom. These results suggest the presence of a local mechanism for the high communication efficiency generally observed in complex systems.",q-bio
925,"A Modified Iterative IOM Approach for Optimization of Biochemical
  Systems","The presented previously indirect optimization method (IOM) developed within biochemical systems theory (BST) provides a versatile and mathematically tractable optimization strategy for biochemical systems. However, due to the local approximations nature of the BST formalism, the iterative version of this technique possibly does not yield the true optimum solution. In this work, an algorithm is proposed to obtain the correct and consistent optimum steady-state operating point of biochemical systems. The existing linear optimization problem of the direct IOM approach is modified by adding an equality constraint of describing the consistency of solutions between the S-system and the original model. Lagrangian analysis is employed to derive the first order necessary optimality conditions for the above modified optimization problem. This leads to a procedure that may be regarded as a modified iterative IOM approach in which the optimization objective function includes an extra linear term. The extra term contains a comparison of metabolite concentration derivatives with respect to the enzyme activities between the S-system and the original model and ensures that the new algorithm is still carried out within linear programming techniques. The presented framework is applied to several biochemical systems and shown to the tractability and effectiveness of the method. The simulation is also studied to investigate the convergence properties of the algorithm and to give a performance comparison of standard and modified iterative IOM approach.",q-bio
926,Generic Properties of Random Gene Regulatory Networks,"Modeling gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is an important topic in systems biology. Although there has been much work focusing on various specific systems, the generic behavior of GRNs with continuous variables is still elusive. In particular, it is not clear typically how attractors partition among the three types of orbits: steady state, periodic and chaotic, and how the dynamical properties change with network's topological characteristics. In this work, we first investigated these questions in random GRNs with different network sizes, connectivity, fraction of inhibitory links and transcription regulation rules. Then we searched for the core motifs that govern the dynamic behavior of large GRNs. We show that the stability of a random GRN is typically governed by a few embedding motifs of small sizes, and therefore can in general be understood in the context of these short motifs. Our results provide insights for the study and design of genetic networks.",q-bio
927,Metabolic Network Modelling: Including Stochastic Effects,"We propose to model the dynamics of metabolic networks from a systems biology point of view by four dynamical structure elements: potential function, transverse matrix, degradation matrix, and stochastic force. These four elements are balanced to determine the network dynamics, which gives arise to a special stochastic differential equation supplemented by a relationship between the stochastic force and the degradation matrix. Important network behaviors can be obtained from the potential function without explicitly solving for the time-dependent solution. The existence of such a potential function suggests a global optimization principle, and the existence stochastic force corresponds natural to the hierarchical structure in metabolic networks. We provide theoretical evidences to justify our proposal by discussing its connections to others large-scale biochemical systems approaches, such as the network thermodynamics theory, biochemical systems theory, metabolic control analysis, and flux balance analysis. Experimental data displaying stochasticity are also pointed out.",q-bio
928,Large individual differences in free recall,"Using single factor ANOVA I show that there are large individual differences in free recall ({\eta} ranges from 0.09-0.26) including the total recall, the balance between recency and primacy, and the initial recall (subsequent recalls show smaller individual differences). All three memory properties are relatively uncorrelated. The variance in the initial position may be a measure of executive control and is correlated with total recall (the smaller the variation, the larger the recall).",q-bio
929,Evolutionary game dynamics in phenotype space,"Evolutionary dynamics can be studied in well-mixed or structured populations. Population structure typically arises from the heterogeneous distribution of individuals in physical space or on social networks. Here we introduce a new type of space to evolutionary game dynamics: phenotype space. The population is well-mixed in the sense that everyone is equally likely to interact with everyone else, but the behavioral strategies depend on distance in phenotype space. Individuals might behave differently towards those who look similar or dissimilar. Individuals mutate to nearby phenotypes. We study the `phenotypic space walk' of populations. We present analytic calculations that bring together ideas from coalescence theory and evolutionary game dynamics. As a particular example, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in phenotype space. We obtain a precise condition for natural selection to favor cooperators over defectors: for a one-dimensional phenotype space and large population size the critical benefit-to-cost ratio is given by b/c=1+2/sqrt{3}. We derive the fundamental condition for any evolutionary game and explore higher dimensional phenotype spaces.",q-bio
930,DNA nano-mechanics: how proteins deform the double helix,"It is a standard exercise in mechanical engineering to infer the external forces and torques on a body from its static shape and known elastic properties. Here we apply this kind of analysis to distorted double-helical DNA in complexes with proteins. We extract the local mean forces and torques acting on each base-pair of bound DNA from high-resolution complex structures. Our method relies on known elastic potentials and a careful choice of coordinates of the well-established rigid base-pair model of DNA. The results are robust with respect to parameter and conformation uncertainty. They reveal the complex nano-mechanical patterns of interaction between proteins and DNA. Being non-trivially and non-locally related to observed DNA conformations, base-pair forces and torques provide a new view on DNA-protein binding that complements structural analysis.",q-bio
931,"Fractal growth of tumors and other cellular populations: Linking the
  mechanistic to the phenomenological modeling and vice versa","In this paper we study and extend the mechanistic mean field theory of growth of cellular populations proposed by Mombach et al in (Mombach J. C. M. et al., Europhysics Letter, 59 (2002) 923) (MLBI model), and we demonstrate that the original model and our generalizations lead to inferences of biological interest. In the first part of this paper, we show that the model in study is widely general since it admits, as particular cases, the main phenomenological models of cellular growth. In the second part of this work, we generalize the \emph{MLBI} model to a wider family of models by allowing the cells to have a generic unspecified biologically plausible interaction. Then, we derive a relationship between this generic microscopic interaction function and the growth rate of the corresponding macroscopic model. Finally, we propose to use this relationship in order to help the investigation of the biological plausibility of phenomenological models of cancer growth.",q-bio
932,Ion-dependent dynamics of DNA ejections for bacteriophage lambda,"We study the control parameters that govern the dynamics of in vitro DNA ejection in bacteriophage lambda. Past work has demonstrated that bacteriophage DNA is highly pressurized; this pressure has been hypothesized to help drive DNA ejection. Ions influence this process by screening charges on DNA; however, a systematic variation of salt concentrations to explore these effects has not been undertaken. To study the nature of the forces driving DNA ejection, we performed in vitro measurements of DNA ejection in bulk and at the single-phage level. We present measurements on the dynamics of ejection and on the self-repulsion force driving ejection. We examine the role of ion concentration and identity in both measurements, and show that the charge of counter-ions is an important control parameter. These measurements show that the frictional force acting on the ejecting DNA is subtly dependent on ionic concentrations for a given amount of DNA in the capsid. We also present evidence that phage DNA forms loops during ejection; we confirm that this effect occurs using optical tweezers. We speculate this facilitates circularization of the genome in the cytoplasm.",q-bio

  dynamics","We address the controversial hot question concerning the validity of the loose-coupling versus the lever-arm models in the actomyosin dynamics by re-interpreting and extending the washboard potential model proposed by some of us in a previous paper. In the new theory, a loose-coupling mechanism co-exists with the deterministic lever-arm model. The synergetic action of a random component, originating from the harnessed thermal energy, and of the power-stroke generated by the lever-arm classical mechanism is seen to yield an excellent fit of the set of data obtained in T.

  intrapair potential","The Yakushevich (Y) model provides a very simple pictures of DNA torsion dynamics, yet yields remarkably correct predictions on certain physical characteristics of the dynamics. In the standard Y model, the interaction between bases of a pair is modelled by a harmonic potential, which becomes anharmonic when described in terms of the rotation angles; here we substitute to this different types of improved potentials, providing a more physical description of the H-bond mediated interactions between the bases. We focus in particular on soliton solutions; the Y model predicts the correct size of the nonlinear excitations supposed to model the ``transcription bubbles'', and this is essentially unchanged with the improved potential. Other features of soliton dynamics, in particular curvature of soliton field configurations and the Peierls-Nabarro barrier, are instead significantly changed.",q-bio
935,"The burden of HIV in a Public Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa","South Africa has the greatest number of people living with HIV in the world but the direct impact of this on the public health system has not been directly measured. Using data from the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, the largest hospital in the Southern Hemisphere, collected between January 2006 and December 2009, we demonstrate directly the scale of the impact of HIV on mortality in health services in the pubic sector in South Africa. During the period under investigation 14,431 people died in the hospital's medical wards, an average of 11 deaths each day. Of those that died 64 per cent of men and 82 per cent of women were HIV positive. Between the ages of 30 and 40, 94 percent of men and 96 percent of women of those that died were HIV-positive. These data not only reflect the extraordinary mortality directly attributable to the epidemic of HIV but also the massive burden placed on the health services at a time when triple combination therapy was available and these HIV-related deaths could have been averted.",q-bio
936,"Quantifying Subtle Regions of Order and Disorder in Tumor Architecture
  by Calculating the Nearest-Neighbor Angular Profile","Pathologists routinely classify breast tumors according to recurring patterns of nuclear grades, cytoplasmic coloration, and large-scale morphological formations (i.e. streams of spindle cells, adenoid islands, etc.). The fact that there are large-scale morphological formations suggest that tumor cells still possess the genetic programming to arrange themselves in orderly patterns. However, small regions of order or subtle patterns of order are invisible to the human eye. The ability to detect subtle regions of order and correlate them with clinical outcome and resistance to treatment can enhance diagnostic efficacy. By measuring the acute angle that results when the line extending from the longest length within a nucleus intersects with the corresponding line of an adjacent nucleus, the degree of alignment between two adjacent nuclei can be measured. Through a series of systematic transformations, subtle regions of order and disorder within a tumor image can be quantified and visualized in the form of a heat map. This numerical transformation of spatial relationships between nuclei within tumors allows for the detection of subtly ordered regions.",q-bio
937,A Symmetry Breaking Model for X Chromosome Inactivation,"In mammals, dosage compensation of X linked genes in female cells is achieved by inactivation of one of their two X chromosomes which is randomly chosen. The earliest steps in X-inactivation (XCI), namely the mechanism whereby cells count their X chromosomes and choose between two equivalent X, remain mysterious. Starting from the recent discovery of X chromosome colocalization at the onset of X-inactivation, we propose a Statistical Mechanics model of XCI, which is investigated by computer simulations and checked against experimental data. Our model describes how a `blocking factor' complex is self-assembled and why only one is formed out of many diffusible molecules, resulting in a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SB) in the binding to two identical chromosomes. These results are used to derive a scenario of biological implications describing all current experimental evidences, e.g., the importance of colocalization.",q-bio
938,Robustness in Gene Circuits: Clustering of Functional Responses,"In contrast to engineering applications, in which the structure of control laws are designed to satisfy prescribed function requirements, in biology it is often necessary to infer gene-circuit function from incomplete data on gene-circuit structure. By using the feed-forward loop as a model system, this paper introduces a technique for classifying gene-circuit function given gene-circuit structure. In simulations performed on a comprehensive set of models that span a broad range of parameter space, some designs are robust, producing one unique type of functional response regardless of parameter selection. Other designs may exhibit a variety of functional responses, depending upon parameter values. We conclude that, although some feed-forward loop models have designs that lend themselves to unique function inference, others have designs for which the function type may be uncertain.",q-bio

Its main positive features are its excellent sensitivity (in the low nanogram range) and the use of very simple and cheap equipment and chemicals. The sequential phases of silver staining are protein fixation, then sensitization, then silver impregnation, and finally image development. Several variants of silver staining are described here, which can be completed in a time range from 2 h to 1 day after the end of the electrophoretic separation. Once completed, the stain is stable for several weeks.",q-bio
940,"Relationship between preexponent and distribution over activation
  barrier energies for enzymatic reactions",A relationship between the preexponent of the rate constant and the distribution over activation barrier energies for enzymatic/protein reactions is revealed. We consider an enzyme solution as an ensemble of individual molecules with different values of the activation barrier energy described by the distribution. From the solvent viscosity effect on the preexponent we derive the integral equation for the distribution and find its approximate solution. Our approach enables us to attain a twofold purpose. On the one hand it yields a simple interpretation of the solvent viscosity dependence for enzymatic/protein reactions that requires neither a modification of the Kramers' theory nor that of the Stokes law. On the other hand our approach enables us to deduce the form of the distribution over activation barrier energies. The obtained function has a familiar bell-shaped form and is in qualitative agreement with the results of single enzyme kinetics measurements. General formalism is exemplified by the analysis of literature experimental data.,q-bio
941,"Bifurcations and dynamics emergent from lattice and continuum models of
  bioactive porous media","We study dynamics emergent from a two-dimensional reaction--diffusion process modelled via a finite lattice dynamical system, as well as an analogous PDE system, involving spatially nonlocal interactions. These models govern the evolution of cells in a bioactive porous medium, with evolution of the local cell density depending on a coupled quasi--static fluid flow problem. We demonstrate differences emergent from the choice of a discrete lattice or a continuum for the spatial domain of such a process. We find long--time oscillations and steady states in cell density in both lattice and continuum models, but that the continuum model only exhibits solutions with vertical symmetry, independent of initial data, whereas the finite lattice admits asymmetric oscillations and steady states arising from symmetry-breaking bifurcations. We conjecture that it is the structure of the finite lattice which allows for more complicated asymmetric dynamics. Our analysis suggests that the origin of both types of oscillations is a nonlocal reaction-diffusion mechanism mediated by quasi-static fluid flow.",q-bio
942,"Limited processivity of single motors improves overall transport flux of
  self-assembled motor-cargo complexes","Single kinesin molecular motors can processively move along a microtubule (MT) a few micrometers on average before dissociating. However, cellular length scales over which transport occurs are several hundred microns and more. Why seemingly unreliable motors are used to transport cellular cargo remains poorly understood. We propose a new theory for how low processivity, the average length of a single bout of directed motion, can enhance cellular transport when motors and cargoes must first diffusively self assemble into complexes. We employ stochastic modeling to determine the effect of processivity on overall cargo transport flux. We show that, under a wide range of physiologically relevant conditions, possessing ""infinite"" processivity does not maximize flux along MTs. Rather, we find that low processivity i.e., weak binding of motors to MTs, is optimal. These results shed light on the relationship between processivity and transport efficiency and offer a new theory for the physiological benefits of low motor processivity.",q-bio
943,"Experimental Evidence Supporting a New ""Osmosis Law & Theory"" Derived
  New Formula that Improves van't Hoff Osmotic Pressure Equation","Experimental data were used to support a new concept of osmotic force and a new osmotic law that can explain the osmotic process without the difficulties encountered with van't Hoff osmotic pressure theory. Derived new osmotic formula with curvilinear equation (via new osmotic law) overcomes the limitations and incompleteness of van't Hoff (linear) osmotic pressure equation, $\pi=(n/v)RT$, (for ideal dilute solution only). The application of this classical theory often resulted in contradiction regardless of miscellaneous explaining efforts. This is due to the lack of a scientific concept like ""osmotic force"" that we believe can elaborate the osmotic process. Via this new concept, the proposed new osmotic law and derived new osmotic pressure equation will greatly complete and improve the theoretical consistency within the scientific framework of osmosis.",q-bio
944,Burst firing is a neural code in an insect auditory system,"Various classes of neurons alternate between high-frequency discharges and silent intervals. This phenomenon is called burst firing. To analyze burst activity in an insect system, grasshopper auditory receptor neurons were recorded in vivo for several distinct stimulus types. The experimental data show that both burst probability and burst characteristics are strongly influenced by temporal modulations of the acoustic stimulus. The tendency to burst, hence, is not only determined by cell-intrinsic processes, but also by their interaction with the stimulus time course. We study this interaction quantitatively and observe that bursts containing a certain number of spikes occur shortly after stimulus deflections of specific intensity and duration. Our findings suggest a sparse neural code where information about the stimulus is represented by the number of spikes per burst, irrespective of the detailed interspike-interval structure within a burst. This compact representation cannot be interpreted as a firing-rate code. An information-theoretical analysis reveals that the number of spikes per burst reliably conveys information about the amplitude and duration of sound transients, whereas their time of occurrence is reflected by the burst onset time. The investigated neurons encode almost half of the total transmitted information in burst activity.",q-bio
945,"Role of electrostatic interactions in amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)
  oligomer formation: A discrete molecular dynamics study","Pathological folding and oligomer formation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are widely perceived as central to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental approaches to study Abeta self-assembly are problematic, because most relevant aggregates are quasi-stable and inhomogeneous. We apply a discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) approach combined with a four-bead protein model to study oligomer formation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). We address the differences between the two most common Abeta alloforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, which oligomerize differently in vitro. We study how the presence of electrostatic interactions (EIs) between pairs of charged amino acids affects Abeta40 and Abeta42 oligomer formation. Our results indicate that EIs promote formation of larger oligomers in both Abeta40 and Abeta42. The Abeta40 size distribution remains unimodal, whereas the Abeta42 distribution is trimodal, as observed experimentally. Abeta42 folded structure is characterized by a turn in the C-terminus that is not present in Abeta40. We show that the same C-terminal region is also responsible for the strongest intermolecular contacts in Abeta42 pentamers and larger oligomers. Our results suggest that this C-terminal region plays a key role in the formation of Abeta42 oligomers and the relative importance of this region increases in the presence of EIs. These results suggest that inhibitors targeting the C-terminal region of Abeta42 oligomers may be able to prevent oligomer formation or structurally modify the assemblies to reduce their toxicity.",q-bio
946,"Glomerular protein separation as a mechanism for powering renal
  concentrating processes","Various models have been proposed to explain the urine concentrating mechanism in mammals, however uncertainty remains regarding the origin of the energy required for the production of concentrated urine. We propose a novel mechanism for concentrating urine. We postulate that the energy for the concentrating process is derived from the osmotic potentials generated by the separation of afferent blood into protein-rich efferent blood and protein-deplete filtrate. These two streams run in mutual juxtaposition along the length of the nephron and are thus suitably arranged to provide the osmotic potential to concentrate the urine. The proposed model is able to qualitatively explain the production of various urine concentrations under different clinical conditions. An approach to testing the feasibility of the hypothesis is proposed.",q-bio
947,"The Bonds of Laughter: A Multidisciplinary Inquiry into the Information
  Processes of Human Laughter","A new core hypothesis on laughter is presented. It has been built by putting together ideas from several disciplines: neurodynamics, evolutionary neurobiology, paleoanthropology, social networks, and communication studies. The hypothesis contributes to ascertain the evolutionary origins of human laughter in connection with its cognitive emotional signaling functions. The new behavioral and neurodynamic tenets introduced about this unusual sound feature of our species justify the ubiquitous presence it has in social interactions and along the life cycle of the individual. Laughter, far from being a curious evolutionary relic or a rather trivial innate behavior, should be considered as a highly efficient tool for inter-individual problem solving and for maintenance of social bonds.",q-bio
948,"Fast, scalable, Bayesian spike identification for multi-electrode arrays","We present an algorithm to identify individual neural spikes observed on high-density multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Our method can distinguish large numbers of distinct neural units, even when spikes overlap, and accounts for intrinsic variability of spikes from each unit. As MEAs grow larger, it is important to find spike-identification methods that are scalable, that is, the computational cost of spike fitting should scale well with the number of units observed. Our algorithm accomplishes this goal, and is fast, because it exploits the spatial locality of each unit and the basic biophysics of extracellular signal propagation. Human intervention is minimized and streamlined via a graphical interface. We illustrate our method on data from a mammalian retina preparation and document its performance on simulated data consisting of spikes added to experimentally measured background noise. The algorithm is highly accurate.",q-bio
949,Context-dependent selection of visuomotor maps,"Behavior results from the integration of ongoing sensory signals and contextual information in various forms, such as past experience, expectations, current goals, etc. Thus, the response to a specific stimulus, say the ringing of a doorbell, varies depending on whether you are at home or in someone else's house. What is the neural basis of this flexibility? What mechanism is capable of selecting, in a context-dependent way, an adequate response to a given stimulus? One possibility is based on a nonlinear neural representation in which context information regulates the gain of stimulus-evoked responses. Here I explore the properties of this mechanism. By means of three hypothetical visuomotor tasks, I study a class of neural network models in which any one of several possible stimulus-response maps or rules can be selected according to context. The underlying mechanism based on gain modulation has three key features: (1) modulating the sensory responses is equivalent to switching on or off different subpopulations of neurons, (2) context does not need to be represented continuously, although this is advantageous for generalization, and (3) context-dependent selection is independent of the discriminability of the stimuli. In all cases, the contextual cues can quickly turn on or off a sensory-motor map, effectively changing the functional connectivity between inputs and outputs in the networks. The model predicts that sensory responses that are nonlinearly modulated by arbitrary context signals should be found in behavioral situations that involve choosing or switching between multiple sensory-motor maps.",q-bio
950,"Storage of phase-coded patterns via STDP in fully-connected and sparse
  network: a study of the network capacity","We study the storage and retrieval of phase-coded patterns as stable dynamical attractors in recurrent neural networks, for both an analog and a integrate-and-fire spiking model. The synaptic strength is determined by a learning rule based on spike-time-dependent plasticity, with an asymmetric time window depending on the relative timing between pre- and post-synaptic activity. We store multiple patterns and study the network capacity.   For the analog model, we find that the network capacity scales linearly with the network size, and that both capacity and the oscillation frequency of the retrieval state depend on the asymmetry of the learning time window. In addition to fully-connected networks, we study sparse networks, where each neuron is connected only to a small number z << N of other neurons. Connections can be short range, between neighboring neurons placed on a regular lattice, or long range, between randomly chosen pairs of neurons. We find that a small fraction of long range connections is able to amplify the capacity of the network. This imply that a small-world-network topology is optimal, as a compromise between the cost of long range connections and the capacity increase.   Also in the spiking integrate and fire model the crucial result of storing and retrieval of multiple phase-coded patterns is observed. The capacity of the fully-connected spiking network is investigated, together with the relation between oscillation frequency of retrieval state and window asymmetry.",q-bio

  Enzyme Reactions",We study kinetic models of reversible enzyme reactions and compare two techniques for analytic approximate solutions of the model. Analytic approximate solutions of non-linear reaction equations for reversible enzyme reactions are calculated using the Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM) and the Simple Iteration Method (SIM). The results of the approximations are similar. The Matlab programs are included in appendices.,q-bio
952,"A Multiphase Model of Growth Factor-Regulated Atherosclerotic Cap
  Formation","Atherosclerosis is characterised by the growth of fatty plaques in the inner (intimal) layer of the artery wall. In mature plaques, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are recruited from the adjacent medial layer to deposit a cap of fibrous collagen over the fatty plaque core. The fibrous cap isolates the thrombogenic content of the plaque from the bloodstream and prevents the formation of blood clots that cause myocardial infarction or stroke. Despite the important protective role of the cap, the mechanisms that regulate cap formation and maintenance are not well understood. It remains unclear why certain caps become stable, while others become vulnerable to rupture. We develop a multiphase PDE model with non-standard boundary conditions to investigate collagen cap formation by SMCs in response to growth factor signals from the endothelium. Diffusible platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates SMC migration, proliferation and collagen degradation, while diffusible transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$ stimulates SMC collagen synthesis and inhibits collagen degradation. The model SMCs respond haptotactically to gradients in the collagen phase and have reduced rates of migration and proliferation in dense collagenous tissue. The model, which is parameterised using a range of in vivo and in vitro experimental data, reproduces several observations from studies of plaque growth in atherosclerosis-prone mice. Numerical simulations and model analysis demonstrate that a stable cap can be formed by a relatively small SMC population and emphasise the critical role of TGF-$\beta$ in effective cap formation and maintenance. These findings provide unique insight into the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may lead to plaque destabilisation and rupture. This work represents an important step towards the development of a comprehensive in silico plaque.",q-bio
953,Review of Quantitative Systems Pharmacological Modeling in Thrombosis,"Hemostasis and thrombosis are often thought as two sides of the same clotting mechanism whereas hemostasis is a natural protective mechanism to prevent bleeding and thrombosis is a blood clot abnormally formulated inside a blood vessel, blocking the normal blood flow. The evidence to date suggests that at least arterial thrombosis results from the same critical pathways of hemostasis. Analysis of these complex processes and pathways using quantitative systems pharmacological model-based approach can facilitate the delineation of the causal pathways that lead to the emergence of thrombosis. In this paper, we provide an overview of the main molecular and physiological mechanisms associated with hemostasis and thrombosis, and review the models and quantitative system pharmacological modeling approaches that are relevant in characterizing the interplay among the multiple factors and pathways of thrombosis. An emphasis is given to computational models for drug development. Future trends are discussed.",q-bio
954,Complex dynamics of a Holling-type IV predator-prey model,"In this paper, we focus on a spatial Holling-type IV predator-prey model which contains some important factors, such as diffusion, noise (random fluctuations) and external periodic forcing. By a brief stability and bifurcation analysis, we arrive at the Hopf and Turing bifurcation surface and derive the symbolic conditions for Hopf and Turing bifurcation in the spatial domain. Based on the stability and bifurcation analysis, we obtain spiral pattern formation via numerical simulation. Additionally, we study the model with colored noise and external periodic forcing. From the numerical results, we know that noise or external periodic forcing can induce instability and enhance the oscillation of the species, and resonant response. Our results show that modeling by reaction-diffusion equations is an appropriate tool for investigating fundamental mechanisms of complex spatiotemporal dynamics.",q-bio
955,"Network algorithmics and the emergence of the cortical synaptic-weight
  distribution","When a neuron fires and the resulting action potential travels down its axon toward other neurons' dendrites, the effect on each of those neurons is mediated by the weight of the synapse that separates it from the firing neuron. This weight, in turn, is affected by the postsynaptic neuron's response through a mechanism that is thought to underlie important processes such as learning and memory. Although of difficult quantification, cortical synaptic weights have been found to obey a long-tailed unimodal distribution peaking near the lowest values, thus confirming some of the predictive models built previously. These models are all causally local, in the sense that they refer to the situation in which a number of neurons all fire directly at the same postsynaptic neuron. Consequently, they necessarily embody assumptions regarding the generation of action potentials by the presynaptic neurons that have little biological interpretability. In this letter we introduce a network model of large groups of interconnected neurons and demonstrate, making none of the assumptions that characterize the causally local models, that its long-term behavior gives rise to a distribution of synaptic weights with the same properties that were experimentally observed. In our model the action potentials that create a neuron's input are, ultimately, the product of network-wide causal chains relating what happens at a neuron to the firings of others. Our model is then of a causally global nature and predicates the emergence of the synaptic-weight distribution on network structure and function. As such, it has the potential to become instrumental also in the study of other emergent cortical phenomena.",q-bio
956,Chemical models of genetic toggle switches,"We study by mean-field analysis and stochastic simulations chemical models for genetic toggle switches formed from pairs of genes that mutually repress each other. In order to determine the stability of the genetic switches, we make a connection with reactive flux theory and transition state theory. The switch stability is characterised by a well defined lifetime $\tau$. We find that $\tau$ grows exponentially with the mean number $\Nmean$ of transcription factor molecules involved in the switching. In the regime accessible to direct numerical simulations, the growth law is well characterised by $\tau\sim\Nmean{}^{\alpha}\exp(b\Nmean)$, where $\alpha$ and $b$ are parameters. The switch stability is decreased by phenomena that increase the noise in gene expression, such as the production of multiple copies of a protein from a single mRNA transcript (shot noise), and fluctuations in the number of proteins produced per transcript. However, robustness against biochemical noise can be drastically enhanced by arranging the transcription factor binding domains on the DNA such that competing transcription factors mutually exclude each other on the DNA. We also elucidate the origin of the enhanced stability of the exclusive switch with respect to that of the general switch: while the kinetic prefactor is roughly the same for both switches, the `barrier' for flipping the switch is significantly higher for the exclusive switch than for the general switch.",q-bio
957,"SARS oubreaks in Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore: the role of diagnosis
  and isolation as a control mechanism","In this article we use global and regional data from the SARS epidemic in conjunction with a model of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, and recovered classes of people (``SEIJR'') to extract average properties and rate constants for those populations. The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between March 31st and April 6th, followed by a {\it significant} slowing in the number of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza \cite{CC2}. Although it would not be surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than ten per cent in some regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the long-term impact of SARS.",q-bio
958,"The fast and the slow axonal transport: a unified approach based on
  cargo and molecular motors coupled dynamics","The origins of the large differences observed to the rates with which the diverse particles are conveyed along axonal microtubules are still a matter of debate in the literature. There is evidence that certain neurodegenerative diseases may be triggered by disturbances to the related transport processes. Motivated by this, we employ a model to investigate the mobility properties of certain cargoes which dynamics are coupled with that of molecular motors on crowded microtubules. For certain initial and boundary conditions, we use the method of characteristics to resolve perturbatively the pair of equations of the Burgers type resulting from a mean-field approach to the original microscopic stochastic model. Extensions to the non-perturbative limits are explored numerically. In this context, we were able to figure out conditions under which cargos average velocities may differ up to orders of magnitude just by changing the number of motors on the considered track. We then discuss possibilities to connect these theoretical predictions with available experimental data about axon transport.",q-bio
959,Fine Discrimination of Analog Patterns by Nonlinear Dendritic Inhibition,"Recent experiments revealed that a certain class of inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex make synapses not onto cell bodies but at distal parts of dendrites of the target neurons, mediating highly nonlinear dendritic inhibition. We propose a novel form of competitive neural network model that realizes such dendritic inhibition. Contrary to the conventional lateral inhibition in neural networks, our dendritic inhibition models don't always show winner-take-all behaviors; instead, they converge to ""I don't know"" states when unknown input patterns are presented. We derive reduced two-dimensional dynamics for the network, showing that a drastic shift of the fixed point from a winner-take-all state to an ""I don't know"" state occurs in accordance with the increase in noise added to the stored patterns. By preventing misrecognition in such a way, dendritic inhibition networks achieve fine pattern discrimination, which could be one of the basic computations by inhibitory connected recurrent neural networks in the brain.",q-bio
960,A model of sympatric speciation through assortative mating,"A microscopic model is developed, within the frame of the theory of quantitative traits, to study both numerically and analytically the combined effect of competition and assortativity on the sympatric speciation process, i.e. speciation in the absence of geographical barriers. Two components of fitness are considered: a static one that describes adaptation to environmental factors not related to the population itself, and a dynamic one that accounts for interactions between organisms, e.g. competition. The effects of finiteness of population size on survival of coexisting species are also accounted for. The simulations show that both in the case of flat and ripid static fitness landscapes, competition and assortativity do exert a synergistic effect on speciation. We also show that competition acts as a stabilizing force against extinction due to random sampling in a finite population. Finally, evidence is shown that speciation can be seen as a phase transition.",q-bio
961,"Action for perception : influence of handedness in visuo-auditory
  sensory substitution",In this preliminary study we address the question of the influence of handedness on the localization of targets perceived through a visuo-auditory substitution device. Participants hold the device in one hand in order to explore the environment and to perceive the target. They point to the estimated location of the target with the other hand. This preliminary results support our hypothesis that pointing is more accurate when the device is held in the right dominant hand. Dexterity has to be attributed to the active part of the perceptive system. This study has obviously to be completed but it shows how the concept of enaction is important and how it can be experimentaly addressed in the field of sensory substitution.,q-bio
962,"Petri-net modeling of B-cell receptor signaling pathways: A case study
  in CLL","Immunology is the emerging research area which deals with the study of the immune system in any living organism. It is modelled through various computational and mathematical models to deal with the problem facing while to boost the immune system of an organism or to fight with the infectious disease at the very initial stage. Such models are very important for a better understanding of the complex behaviour of pathways inside the cells. The signalling pathways between the cells are complex and difficult to visualize in the immune system of human beings. So, it's important to study the function of these cells separately. T-cells and B-cells are an important part of the immune system and both have their own receptors and their different signalling pathways by which they deal with any antigens. In this paper, we discuss the B-cell receptor and its different signalling pathways downstream of the BCR. We designed a Petri-net model of the process of gathering antigens through B-cells independent of T-cell and the effect of that in the immune system of the organism. We will also discuss the contribution of BCR in the selection of the precursor tumour cell in CLL.",q-bio
963,"Three-dimensional contact of TITH cartilage layers, a closed-form
  solution","Inhomogeneity and anisotropy play a crucial role in attributing articular cartilage its properties. The frictionless contact model constructed here consists in two thin biphasic transversely isotropic transversely homogeneous (TITH) cartilage layers firmly attached onto rigid substrates and shaped as elliptic paraboloids of different radii. Using asymptotic techniques, a solution to the deformation problem of such material has been recently obtained extending previous ones referred to homogeneous materials. The layer itself is thin in comparison with the size of the contact area and the observed time is shorter than the hydrogel characteristic time. The emerging three-dimensional contact problem is solved in closed-form and numerical benchmarks for constant and oscillating loads are given. The results are shown in terms of contact pressure and approach of the bones. The latter is derived to be directly proportional to the contact area. Existing experimental data are reinterpreted in view of the current model formulation. Comparisons are made with existing solutions for homogeneous biphasic materials in order to underline the functional importance of inhomogeneity in spreading the contact pressure distribution across the contact area. Particular attention is paid to the applicability of the retrieved formulas for interpreting measurements of in vivo experiments. Future directions are also prospected.",q-bio
964,Codon Usage Bias Measured Through Entropy Approach,"Codon usage bias measure is defined through the mutual entropy calculation of real codon frequency distribution against the quasi-equilibrium one. This latter is defined in three manners: (1) the frequency of synonymous codons is supposed to be equal (i.e., the arithmetic mean of their frequencies); (2) it coincides to the frequency distribution of triplets; and, finally, (3) the quasi-equilibrium frequency distribution is defined as the expected frequency of codons derived from the dinucleotide frequency distribution. The measure of bias in codon usage is calculated for 125 bacterial genomes.",q-bio
965,"Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based
  on Polymorphism and Divergence","Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but extracting this information for short, widely scattered noncoding elements remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a new computational method for addressing this problem called Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomically coHerent elemenTs (INSIGHT). INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and genealogical backgrounds. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. Information about divergence is obtained from multiple outgroup genomes using a full phylogenetic model. The model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data by decomposing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure into three straightforward stages. The key selection-related parameters are estimated by expectation maximization. Using simulations, we show that INSIGHT can accurately estimate several parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios. We apply our methods to noncoding RNAs, promoter regions, and transcription factor binding sites in the human genome, and find clear evidence of natural selection. We also present a detailed analysis of particular nucleotide positions within GATA2 binding sites and primary micro-RNA transcripts.",q-bio
966,The Context Sensitivity Problem in Biological Sequence Segmentation,"In this paper, we describe the context sensitivity problem encountered in partitioning a heterogeneous biological sequence into statistically homogeneous segments. After showing signatures of the problem in the bacterial genomes of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, when these are segmented using two entropic segmentation schemes, we clarify the contextual origins of these signatures through mean-field analyses of the segmentation schemes. Finally, we explain why we believe all sequence segmentation schems are plagued by the context sensitivity problem.",q-bio
967,Sympatric Speciation in a Simple Food Web,"Observations of the evolution of species groups in nature, such as well recognized Galapagos finches, have motivated much theoretical research aimed at understanding the processes associated with such radiations. The Penna model is one such model and has been widely used to study aging. In this paper we use the basic Penna model to investigate the process of sympatric speciation in a simple food web model. Initially our web consists of a primary food source and a single herbivore species that feeds on this resource. Subsequently we introduce a predator that feeds on the herbivore. In both instances we directly manipulate the food source, that is, its size distribution, and monitore the changes in the populations structures. Sympatric speciation is obtained for the consumer species in both webs, and our results confirm that the speciation velocity depends on how far up,in the food chain, the focus population is feeding. Simulations are done with three different sexual imprinting-like mechanisms, in order to discuss adaptation by natural selection.",q-bio
968,"Analyzing the Dynamic Relationship between Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis
  in a Two Dimensional Finite Element Model","Employing a novel two-dimensional computational model we have simulated the feedback between angiogenesis and tumor growth dynamics. Analyzing vessel formation and elongation towards the concentration gradient of the tumor-derived angiogenetic basic fibroblast growth factor, bFGF, we assumed that prior to the blood vessels reaching the tumor surface, the resulting pattern of tumor growth is symmetric, circular with a common center point. However, after the vessels reach the tumor surface, we assumed that the growth rate of that particular cancer region is accelerated compared to the tumor surface section that lacks neo-vascularization. Therefore, the resulting asymmetric tumor growth pattern is biased towards the site of the nourishing vessels. The simulation results show over time an increase in vessel density, a decrease in vessel branching length, and an increase in fracticality of the vascular branching architecture. Interestingly, over time the fractal dimension displayed a sigmoidal pattern with a reduced rate increase at earlier and later tumor growth stages due to distinct characteristics in vessel length and density. The finding that, at later stages, higher vascular fracticality resulted in a marked increase of tumor slice volume provides further in silico evidence for a functional impact of vascular patterns on cancer growth.",q-bio
969,"Topological change and impedance spectrum of rat olfactory receptor I7:
  A comparative analysis with bovine rhodopsin and bacterior","We present a theoretical investigation on possible selection of olfactory receptors (ORs) as sensing components of nanobiosensors. Accordingly, we generate the impedance spectra of the rat OR I7 in the native and activated state and analyze their differences. In this way, we connect the protein morphological transformation, caused by the sensing action, with its change of electrical impedance. The results are compared with those obtained by studying the best known protein of the GPCR family: bovine rhodopsin. Our investigations indicate that a change in morphology goes with a change in impedance spectrum mostly associated with a decrease of the static impedance up to about 60 % of the initial value, in qualitative agreement with existing experiments on rat OR I7. The predictiveness of the model is tested successfully for the case of recent experiments on bacteriorhodopsin. The present results point to a promising development of a new class of nanobiosensors based on the electrical properties of GPCR and other sensing proteins.",q-bio
970,Rapid micro fluorescence in situ hybridization in tissue sections,"This paper describes a micro fluorescence in situ hybridization ({\mu}FISH)-based rapid detection of cytogenetic biomarkers on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. We demonstrated this method in the context of detecting human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) in breast tissue sections. This method uses a non-contact microfluidic scanning probe (MFP), which localizes FISH probes at the micrometer length-scale to selected cells of the tissue section. The scanning ability of the MFP allows for a versatile implementation of FISH on tissue sections. We demonstrated the use of oligonucleotide FISH probes in ethylene carbonate-based buffer enabling rapid hybridization within < 1 min for chromosome enumeration and 10-15 min for assessment of the HER2 status in FFPE sections. We further demonstrated recycling of FISH probes for multiple sequential tests using a defined volume of probes by forming hierarchical hydrodynamic flow confinements. This microscale method is compatible with the standard FISH protocols and with the Instant Quality (IQ) FISH assay, reduces the FISH probe consumption ~100-fold and the hybridization time 4-fold, resulting in an assay turnaround time of < 3 h. We believe rapid {\mu}FISH has the potential of being used in pathology workflows as a standalone method or in combination with other molecular methods for diagnostic and prognostic analysis of FFPE sections.",q-bio
971,Allosteric control in icosahedral capsid assembly,"During the lifecycle of a virus, viral proteins and other components self-assemble to form a symmetric protein shell called a capsid. This assembly process is subject to multiple competing constraints, including the need to form a thermostable shell while avoiding kinetic traps. It has been proposed that viral assembly satisfies these constraints through allosteric regulation, including the interconversion of capsid proteins among conformations with different propensities for assembly. In this article we use computational and theoretical modeling to explore how such allostery affects the assembly of icosahedral shells. We simulate assembly under a wide range of protein concentrations, protein binding affinities, and two different mechanisms of allosteric control. We find that, above a threshold strength of allosteric control, assembly becomes robust over a broad range of subunit binding affinities and concentrations, allowing the formation of highly thermostable capsids. Our results suggest that allostery can significantly shift the range of protein binding affinities that lead to successful assembly, and thus should be accounted for in models that are used to estimate interaction parameters from experimental data.",q-bio

  of representations","As subjects perceive the sensory world, different stimuli elicit a number of neural representations. Here, a subjective distance between stimuli is defined, measuring the degree of similarity between the underlying representations. As an example, the subjective distance between different locations in space is calculated from the activity of rodent hippocampal place cells, and lateral septal cells. Such a distance is compared to the real distance, between locations. As the number of sampled neurons increases, the subjective distance shows a tendency to resemble the metrics of real space.",q-bio
973,A Comparison and Catalog of Intrinsic Tumor Growth Models,"Determining the mathematical dynamics and associated parameter values that should be used to accurately reflect tumor growth continues to be of interest to mathematical modelers, experimentalists and practitioners. However, while there are several competing canonical tumor growth models that are often implemented, how to determine which of the models should be used for which tumor types remains an open question. In this work, we determine the best fit growth dynamics and associated parameter ranges for ten different tumor types by fitting growth functions to at least five sets of published experimental growth data per type of tumor. These time-series tumor growth data are used to determine which of the five most common tumor growth models (exponential, power law, logistic, Gompertz, or von Bertalanffy) provides the best fit for each type of tumor.",q-bio
974,"Sloppiness, robustness, and evolvability in systems biology","The functioning of many biochemical networks is often robust -- remarkably stable under changes in external conditions and internal reaction parameters. Much recent work on robustness and evolvability has focused on the structure of neutral spaces, in which system behavior remains invariant to mutations. Recently we have shown that the collective behavior of multiparameter models is most often 'sloppy': insensitive to changes except along a few 'stiff' combinations of parameters, with an enormous sloppy neutral subspace. Robustness is often assumed to be an emergent evolved property, but the sloppiness natural to biochemical networks offers an alternative non-adaptive explanation. Conversely, ideas developed to study evolvability in robust systems can be usefully extended to characterize sloppy systems.",q-bio
975,"Interlinked Dual-Time Feedback Loops can Enhance Robustness to
  Stochasticity and Persistence of Memory","Multiple interlinked positive feedback loops shape the stimulus responses of various biochemical systems, such as the cell cycle or intracellular calcium release. Recent studies with simplified models have identified two advantages of coupling fast and slow feedback loops. Namely, this dual-time structure enables a fast response while enhancing resistances of responses and bistability to stimulus noise. We now find that in addition: 1) the dual-time structure confers resistance to internal noise due to molecule number fluctuations, and 2) model variants with altered coupling, which better represent some specific systems, share all the above advantages. We develop a similar bistable model with a fast autoactivation loop coupled to a slow loop, which minimally represents positive feedback that may be essential for long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). The advantages of fast response and noise resistance carry over to this model. Empirically, LTP develops resistance to reversal over ~1 h. The model suggests this resistance may result from increased amounts of synaptic kinases involved in positive feedback.",q-bio
976,Extracting Hidden Hierarchies in 3D Distribution Networks,"Natural and man-made transport webs are frequently dominated by dense sets of nested cycles. The architecture of these networks, as defined by the topology and edge weights, determines how efficiently the networks perform their function. Yet, the set of tools that can characterize such a weighted cycle-rich architecture in a physically relevant, mathematically compact way is sparse. In order to fill this void, we have developed a new algorithm that rests on an abstraction of the physical `tiling' in the case of a two dimensional network to an effective tiling of an abstract surface in space that the network may be thought to sit in. Generically these abstract surfaces are richer than the flat plane and as a result there are now two families of fundamental units that may aggregate upon cutting weakest links -- the plaquettes of the tiling and the longer `topological' cycles associated with the abstract surface itself. Upon sequential removal of the weakest links, as determined by the edge weight, neighboring plaquettes merge and a tree characterizing this merging process results. The properties of this characteristic tree can provide the physical and topological data required to describe the architecture of the network and to build physical models. The new algorithm can be used for automated phenotypic characterization of any weighted network whose structure is dominated by cycles, such as mammalian vasculature in the organs, the root networks of clonal colonies like quaking aspen, or the force networks in jammed granular matter.",q-bio
977,"A SAT-Based Algorithm for Computing Attractors in Synchronous Boolean
  Networks","This paper addresses the problem of finding cycles in the state transition graphs of synchronous Boolean networks. Synchronous Boolean networks are a class of deterministic finite state machines which are used for the modeling of gene regulatory networks. Their state transition graph cycles, called attractors, represent cell types of the organism being modeled. When the effect of a disease or a mutation on an organism is studied, attractors have to be re-computed every time a fault is injected in the model. We present an algorithm for finding attractors which uses a SAT-based bounded model checking. Novel features of the algorithm compared to the traditional SAT-based bounded model checking approaches are: (1) a termination condition which does not require an explicit computation of the diameter and (2) a technique to reduce the number of additional clauses which are needed to make paths loop-free. The presented algorithm uses much less space than existing BDD-based approaches and has a potential to handle several orders of magnitude larger networks.",q-bio
978,"The ""Giant Virus Finder"" Discovers an Abundance of Giant Viruses in the
  Antarctic Dry Valleys","The first giant virus was identified in 2003 from a biofilm of an industrial water-cooling tower in England. Later, numerous new giant viruses were found in oceans and freshwater habitats, some of them having even 2,500 genes. We have demonstrated their very likely presence in four soil samples taken from the Kutch Desert (Gujarat, India). Here we describe a bioinformatics work-flow, called the ""Giant Virus Finder"" that is capable to discover the very likely presence of the genomes of giant viruses in metagenomic shotgun-sequenced datasets. The new tool is applied to numerous hot and cold desert soil samples as well as some tundra- and forest soils. We show that most of these samples contain giant viruses, and especially many were found in the Antarctic dry valleys. The results imply that giant viruses could be frequent not only in aqueous habitats, but in a wide spectrum of soils on our planet.",q-bio
979,Non-alignment comparison of human and high primate genomes,"Compositional spectra (CS) analysis based on k-mer scoring of DNA sequences was employed in this study for dot-plot comparison of human and primate genomes. The detection of extended conserved synteny regions was based on continuous fuzzy similarity rather than on chains of discrete anchors (genes or highly conserved noncoding elements). In addition to the high correspondence found in the comparisons of whole-genome sequences, a good similarity was also found after masking gene sequences, indicating that CS analysis manages to reveal phylogenetic signal in the organization of noncoding part of the genome sequences, including repetitive DNA and the genome ""dark matter"". Obviously, the possibility to reveal parallel ordering depends on the signal of common ancestor sequence organization varying locally along the corresponding segments of the compared genomes. We explored two sources contributing to this signal: sequence composition (GC content) and sequence organization (abundances of k-mers in the usual A,T,G,C or purine-pyrimidine alphabets). Whole-genome comparisons based on GC distribution along the analyzed sequences indeed gives reasonable results, but combining it with k-mer abundances dramatically improves the ordering quality, indicating that compositional and organizational heterogeneity comprise complementary sources of information on evolutionary conserved similarity of genome sequences.",q-bio
980,Mechanisms of Protein Search for Targets on DNA: Theoretical Insights,"Protein-DNA interactions are critical for the successful functioning of all natural systems. The key role in these interactions is played by processes of protein search for specific sites on DNA. Although it has been studied for many years, only recently microscopic aspects of these processes became more clear. In this work, we present a review on current theoretical understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the protein target search. A comprehensive discrete-state stochastic method to explain the dynamics of the protein search phenomena is introduced and explained. Our theoretical approach utilizes a first-passage analysis and it takes into account the most relevant physical-chemical processes. It is able to describe many fascinating features of the protein search, including unusually high effective association rates, high selectivity and specificity, and the robustness in the presence of crowders and sequence heterogeneity.",q-bio
981,From DNA sequence analysis to modeling replication in the human genome,"We explore the large-scale behavior of nucleotide compositional strand asymmetries along human chromosomes. As we observe for 7 of 9 origins of replication experimentally identified so far, the (TA+GC) skew displays rather sharp upward jumps, with a linear decreasing profile in between two successive jumps. We present a model of replication with well positioned replication origins and random terminations that accounts for the observed characteristic serrated skew profiles. We succeed in identifying 287 pairs of putative adjacent replication origins with an origin spacing approximately 1-2 Mbp that are likely to correspond to replication foci observed in interphase nuclei and recognized as stable structures that persist throughout subsequent cell generations.",q-bio
982,Vaccination pattern affects immunological response,The response of the immune system to different vaccination patterns is studied with a simple model. It is argued that the history and characteristics of the pattern defines very different secondary immune responses in the case of infection. The memory function of the immune response can be set to work in very different modes depending on the pattern followed during immunizations. It is argued that the history and pattern of immunizations can be a decisive (and experimentally accessible) factor to tailor the effectiveness of a specific vaccine.,q-bio
983,"Evolution of macromolecular structure: a 'double tale' of biological
  accretion","The evolution of structure in biology is driven by accretion and change. Accretion brings together disparate parts to form bigger wholes. Change provides opportunities for growth and innovation. Here we review patterns and processes that are responsible for a 'double tale' of evolutionary accretion at various levels of complexity, from proteins and nucleic acids to high-rise building structures in cities. Parts are at first weakly linked and associate variously. As they diversify, they compete with each other and are selected for performance. The emerging interactions constrain their structure and associations. This causes parts to self-organize into modules with tight linkage. In a second phase, variants of the modules evolve and become new parts for a new generative cycle of higher-level organization. Evolutionary genomics and network biology support the 'double tale' of structural module creation and validate an evolutionary principle of maximum abundance that drives the gain and loss of modules.",q-bio
984,"Automated Quantification of the Impact of the Wood-decay fungus
  Physisporinus vitreus on the Cell Wall Structure of Norway spruce by
  Tomographic Microscopy","Wood-decay fungi decompose their substrate by extracellular, degradative enzymes and play an important role in natural ecosystems by recycling carbon and minerals fixed in plants. Thereby, they cause significant damage to the wood structure and limit the use of wood as building material. Besides their role as biodeteriorators wood-decay fungi can be used for biotechnological purposes, e.g. the white-rot fungus Physisporinus vitreus for improving the uptake of preservatives and wood-modification substances of refractory wood. Therefore, the visualization and the quantification of microscopic decay patterns are important for the study of the impact of wood-decay fungi in general, as well as for wood-decay fungi and microorganisms with possible applications in biotechnology. In the present work, we developed a method for the automated localization and quantification of microscopic cell wall elements (CWE) of Norway spruce wood such as bordered pits, intrinsic defects, hyphae or alterations induced by P. vitreus using high resolution X-ray computed tomographic microscopy. In addition to classical destructive wood anatomical methods such as light or laser scanning microscopy, our method allows for the first time to compute the properties (e.g. area, orientation and size-distribution) of CWE of the tracheids in a sample. This is essential for modeling the influence of microscopic CWE to macroscopic properties such as wood strength and permeability.",q-bio
985,pH/$T$ duality - wall properties and time evolution of plant cells,"We examined the pH/$T$ (or $\mu$/$T$) duality of acidic pH and temperature ($T$) for the growth of grass shoots in order to determine the equation of state (EoS) for living plants. By considering non-meristematic growth as a dynamic series of 'state transitions' (STs) in the extending primary wall, we identified the critical (read: optimum) exponents for this phenomenon, which exhibit a singular behaviour at a critical temperature, critical pH and critical chemical potential ($\mu$) in the form of four power laws: $F(\tau)_\pi\propto|\tau|^{\beta-1}$, $F(\pi)_\tau\propto|\pi|^{1-\alpha}$, $G(\tau)_\mu\propto|\tau|^{-2-\alpha+2\beta}$ and $G(\mu)_\tau\propto|\mu|^{2-\alpha}$. The power-law exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are numbers, which are independent of pH (or $\mu$) and $T$ that are known as critical exponents, while $\pi$ and $\tau$ represent a reduced pH and reduced temperature, respectively. Various 'scaling' predictions were obtained - a convexity relation $\alpha + \beta \ge 2$ for practical pH-based analysis and a $\beta \equiv 2$ identity in microscopic representation. In the presented scenario, the magnitude that is decisive is the chemical potential of H$^+$ ions (protons), enforcing subsequent STs and growth. The EoS span areas of the biological, physical, chemical and Earth sciences cross the borders with the language (adapted formalism) of phase transitions.",q-bio
986,High-speed and accurate color-space short-read alignment with CUSHAW2,"Summary: We present an extension of CUSHAW2 for fast and accurate alignments of SOLiD color-space short-reads. Our extension introduces a double-seeding approach to improve mapping sensitivity, by combining maximal exact match seeds and variable-length seeds derived from local alignments. We have compared the performance of CUSHAW2 to SHRiMP2 and BFAST by aligning both simulated and real color-space mate-paired reads to the human genome. The results show that CUSHAW2 achieves comparable or better alignment quality compared to SHRiMP2 and BFAST at an order-of-magnitude faster speed and significantly smaller peak resident memory size.

987,"Protein signatures using electrostatic molecular surfaces in harmonic
  space","We developed a novel method based on the Fourier analysis of protein molecular surfaces to speed up the analysis of the vast structural data generated in the post-genomic era. This method computes the power spectrum of surfaces of the molecular electrostatic potential, whose three-dimensional coordinates have been either experimentally or theoretically determined. Thus we achieve a reduction of the initial three-dimensional information on the molecular surface to the one-dimensional information on pairs of points at a fixed scale apart. Consequently, the similarity search in our method is computationally less demanding and significantly faster than shape comparison methods. As proof of principle, we applied our method to a training set of viral proteins that are involved in major diseases such as Hepatitis C, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, Bovine viral diarrhea and West Nile fever. The training set contains proteins of four different protein families, as well as a mammalian representative enzyme. We found that the power spectrum successfully assigns a unique signature to each protein included in our training set, thus providing a direct probe of functional similarity among proteins. The results agree with established biological data from conventional structural biochemistry analyses.",q-bio
988,"Early events in insulin fibrillization studied by time-lapse atomic
  force microscopy","The importance of understanding the mechanism of protein aggregation into insoluble amyloid fibrils relies not only on its medical consequences, but also on its more basic properties of self--organization. The discovery that a large number of uncorrelated proteins can form, under proper conditions, structurally similar fibrils has suggested that the underlying mechanism is a general feature of polypeptide chains. In the present work, we address the early events preceeding amyloid fibril formation in solutions of zinc--free human insulin incubated at low pH and high temperature. Aside from being a easy--to--handle model for protein fibrillation, subcutaneous aggregation of insulin after injection is a nuisance which affects patients with diabetes. Here, we show by time--lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) that a steady-state distribution of protein oligomers with an exponential tail is reached within few minutes after heating. This metastable phase lasts for few hours until aggregation into fibrils suddenly occurs. A theoretical explanation of the oligomer pre--fibrillar distribution is given in terms of a simple coagulation--evaporation kinetic model, in which concentration plays the role of a critical parameter. Due to high resolution and sensitivity of AFM technique, the observation of a long-lasting latency time should be considered an actual feature of the aggregation process, and not simply ascribed to instrumental inefficency. These experimental facts, along with the kinetic model used, claim for a critical role of thermal concentration fluctuations in the process of fibril nucleation.",q-bio
989,"Is a gene-centric human proteome project the best way for proteomics to
  serve biology?","With the recent developments in proteomic technologies, a complete human proteome project (HPP) appears feasible for the first time. However, there is still debate as to how it should be designed and what it should encompass. In ""proteomics speak"", the debate revolves around the central question as to whether a gene-centric or a protein-centric proteomics approach is the most appropriate way forward. In this paper, we try to shed light on what these definitions mean, how large-scale proteomics such as a HPP can insert into the larger omics chorus, and what we can reasonably expect from a HPP in the way it has been proposed so far.",q-bio
990,"Tug-of-war as a cooperative mechanism for bidirectional cargo transport
  by molecular motors","Intracellular transport is based on molecular motors that pull cargos along cytoskeletal filaments. One motor species always moves in one direction, e.g. conventional kinesin moves to the microtubule plus end, while cytoplasmic dynein moves to the microtubule minus end. However, many cellular cargos are observed to move bidirectionally, involving both plus-end and minus-end directed motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional transport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This mechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport properties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In contrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly cooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the precise values of the single motor parameters. The sensitivity of the transport process to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its cargo traffic.",q-bio
991,Geometric and physical considerations for realistic protein models,"Protein structure is generally conceptualized as the global arrangement or of smaller, local motifs of helices, sheets, and loops. These regular, recurring secondary structural elements have well-understood and standardized definitions in terms of amino acid backbone geometry and the manner in which hydrogen bonding requirements are satisfied. Recently, ""tube"" models have been proposed to explain protein secondary structure in terms of the geometrically optimal packing of a featureless cylinder. However, atomically detailed simulations demonstrate that such packing considerations alone are insufficient for defining secondary structure; both excluded volume and hydrogen bonding must be explicitly modeled for helix formation. These results have fundamental implications for the construction and interpretation of realistic and meaningful biomacromolecular models.",q-bio
992,Progress in the definition of a reference human mitochondrial proteome,"Owing to the complexity of higher eukaryotic cells, a complete proteome is likely to be very difficult to achieve. However, advantage can be taken of the cell compartmentalization to build organelle proteomes, which can moreover be viewed as specialized tools to study specifically the biology and ""physiology"" of the target organelle. Within this frame, we report here the construction of the human mitochondrial proteome, using placenta as the source tissue. Protein identification was carried out mainly by peptide mass fingerprinting. The optimization steps in two-dimensional electrophoresis needed for proteome research are discussed. However, the relative paucity of data concerning mitochondrial proteins is still the major limiting factor in building the corresponding proteome, which should be a useful tool for researchers working on human mitochondria and their deficiencies.",q-bio
993,"Cellular decision-making bias: the missing ingredient in cell functional
  diversity","Cell functional diversity is a significant determinant on how biological processes unfold. Most accounts of diversity involve a search for sequence or expression differences. Perhaps there are more subtle mechanisms at work. Using the metaphor of information processing and decision-making might provide a clearer view of these subtleties. Understanding adaptive and transformative processes (such as cellular reprogramming) as a series of simple decisions allows us to use a technique called cellular signal detection theory (cellular SDT) to detect potential bias in mechanisms that favor one outcome over another. We can apply method of detecting cellular reprogramming bias to cellular reprogramming and other complex molecular processes. To demonstrate scope of this method, we will critically examine differences between cell phenotypes reprogrammed to muscle fiber and neuron phenotypes. In cases where the signature of phenotypic bias is cryptic, signatures of genomic bias (pre-existing and induced) may provide an alternative. The examination of these alternates will be explored using data from a series of fibroblast cell lines before cellular reprogramming (pre-existing) and differences between fractions of cellular RNA for individual genes after drug treatment (induced). In conclusion, the usefulness and limitations of this method and associated analogies will be discussed.",q-bio
994,Modeling Dual Pathways for the Metazoan Spindle Assembly Checkpoint,"Using computational modelling, we investigate mechanisms of signal transduction focusing on the spindle assembly checkpoint where a single unattached kinetochore is able to signal to prevent cell cycle progression. This inhibitory signal switches off rapidly once spindle microtubules have attached to all kinetochores. This requirement tightly constrains the possible mechanisms. Here we investigate two possible mechanisms for spindle checkpoint operation in metazoan cells, both supported by recent experiments. The first involves the free diffusion and sequestration of cell-cycle regulators. This mechanism is severely constrained both by experimental fluorescence recovery data and also by the large volumes involved in open mitosis in metazoan cells. Using a simple mathematical analysis and computer simulation, we find that this mechanism can generate the inhibition found in experiment but likely requires a two stage signal amplification cascade. The second mechanism involves spatial gradients of a short-lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion but then primarily via active transport along spindle microtubules. We propose that both mechanisms may be operative in the metazoan spindle assembly checkpoint, with either able to trigger anaphase onset even without support from the other pathway.",q-bio

997,Unraveling Adaptation in Eukaryotic Pathways: Lessons from Protocells,"Eukaryotic adaptation pathways operate within wide-ranging environmental conditions without stimulus saturation. Despite numerous differences in the adaptation mechanisms employed by bacteria and eukaryotes, all require energy consumption. Here, we present two minimal models showing that expenditure of energy by the cell is not essential for adaptation. Both models share important features with large eukaryotic cells: they employ small diffusible molecules and involve receptor subunits resembling highly conserved G-protein cascades. Analyzing the drawbacks of these models helps us understand the benefits of energy consumption, in terms of adjustability of response and adaptation times as well as separation of cell-external sensing and cell-internal signaling. Our work thus sheds new light on the evolution of adaptation mechanisms in complex systems.",q-bio
998,"Virtual Identification of Essential Proteins Within the Protein
  Interaction Network of Yeast","Topological analysis of large scale protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) is important for understanding the organisational and functional principles of individual proteins. The number of interactions that a protein has in a PIN has been observed to be correlated with its indispensability. Essential proteins generally have more interactions than the non-essential ones. We show here that the lethality associated with removal of a protein from the yeast proteome correlates with different centrality measures of the nodes in the PIN, such as the closeness of a protein to many other proteins, or the number of pairs of proteins which need a specific protein as an intermediary in their communications, or the participation of a protein in different protein clusters in the PIN. These measures are significantly better than random selection in identifying essential proteins in a PIN. Centrality measures based on graph spectral properties of the network, in particular the subgraph centrality, show the best performance in identifying essential proteins in the yeast PIN. Subgraph centrality gives important structural information about the role of individual proteins and permits the selection of possible targets for rational drug discovery through the identification of essential proteins in the PIN.",q-bio
999,"The architecture of co-culture spheroids regulates tumor invasion within
  a 3D extracellular matrix","Tumor invasion, the process by which tumor cells break away from their primary tumor and gain access to vascular systems, is an important step in cancer metastasis. Most current 3D tumor invasion assays consisted of single tumor cells embedded within an extracellular matrix (ECM). These assays taught us much of what we know today on how key biophysical (e.g. ECM stiffness) and biochemical (e.g. cytokine gradients) parameters within the tumor microenvironment guided and regulated tumor invasion. One limitation of the single tumor cell invasion assay was that it did not account for cell-cell adhesion within the tumor. In this article, we developed a micrometer scale 3D co-culture spheroid invasion assay that was compatible with microscopic imaging. Micrometer scale co-culture spheroids (1:1 ratio of metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and non-tumorigenic epithelial MCF-10A cells) were made using an array of microwells, and then were embedded within a collagen matrix in a microfluidic platform. Real time imaging of tumor spheroid invasion revealed that the spatial distribution of the two cell types within the tumor spheroid critically regulated tumor invasion. This work linked tumor architecture with tumor invasion and highlighted the importance of the biophysical cues within the bulk of the tumor in tumor invasion.",q-bio
